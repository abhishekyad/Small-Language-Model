ARCADIA, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE____________
____________
____________
The Arcadia, California Municipal Code, originally published by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., has been kept current by
regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest.
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Matthew Bender and
Company, Inc. under the direction of the city attorney.
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to
facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence,
the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most
instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to
accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion.
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section.
This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all
ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 22, legislation can be
tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List."
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers.Municipal Code Corporation

This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens.

The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile
numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title,
then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is
Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2.
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles.
For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption
and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are  for
later use.
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject
are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing
chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be
added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney.
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion
of the Code without renumbering.
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the
main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and
sections, respectively.
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that
section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).)
Beginning with Supplement No. 22 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance
history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to
the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index.
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the
municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated.
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references
in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists
the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein."
As of Supplement No. 22, this table will no longer be updated.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This
very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance
number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or
chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not
normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some
reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other
dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)."
Beginning with Supplement No. 22 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List."
Beginning with Supplement No. 22, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking
legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for
codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the
ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the
reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier
subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of
the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings:
BUSINESS LICENSE
See also BUSINESS TAX
Fee 5.04.030
Required when 5.04.010
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended.
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the
date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be
pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is
kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference.
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 22, when new pages
are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33).
Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved"
for later use.
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can
accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can
send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code
more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: .Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

has not been successfully challenged by a timely writ of mandate, this obligation may constitute a lien against the real
property on which the violation occurred.
The lien provided herein shall have no force and effect until recorded with the County Recorder. Once recorded, the
administrative order shall have the force and effect and priority of a judgment lien governed by the provisions of
Section 697.340 of the Code of Civil Procedure and may be extended as provided in Sections 683.110 to 683.220,
inclusive, of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the judgment remaining unsatisfied pursuant to law.

stating the amounts due and owing.
The City Clerk shall fix a time, date and place for hearing such report and any protests or objections thereto by City
Council.

The City Council, after the hearing, shall adopt a resolution confirming, discharging or modifying the amount of the lien.1458. - RECORDING OF LIEN.Thirty (30) days following the adoption of a resolution by the City Council imposing a lien, the City Clerk shall file the same as a
judgment lien in the office of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, California. The lien may carry such additional
administrative charges as set forth by resolution of the City Council.1459. - SATISFACTION OF LIEN.Once payment in full is received by the City for outstanding penalties and costs, the Administrative Services Director shall
either record a notice of satisfaction or provide the property owner or financial institution with a notice of satisfaction so they
may record this notice with the office of the County Recorder. Such notice of satisfaction shall cancel the City's lien.

of Arcadia, or a bidder's bond executed by a surety admitted to engage in such business in the State of California, for an amount
equal to [ten percent] (10%) of the amount of the Proposal, and no Proposal shall be considered unless such proposal guarantee
is properly enclosed therewith. The proposal guarantee shall be forfeited if the Proposal is withdrawn beyond the submission

the Design-Build Entity submitting the Proposal found to be most advantageous to the City as the Best Value.
(Added by Ord. No. 2305 adopted 12-4-12)1948. - SUBCONTRACTOR LISTING.The City recognizes that the Design-Build Entity is charged with performing both design and construction. Because a Design-
Build Contract may be awarded prior to the completion of the design, it is often impracticable for the Design-Build Entity to list all
subcontractors at the time of the award.
It is the intent of the City to establish a clear process for the selection and award of subcontracts entered into
pursuant to this Chapter in a manner that retains protection for subcontractors while enabling the Design-Build
project to be administered in an efficient fashion.
All of the following requirements shall apply to subcontractors, licensed by the State, that are employed on Design-
Build projects undertaken pursuant to this Chapter.
The Request for Proposals shall specify the essential design disciplines, construction trades or types of
subcontractors that must be listed by the Design-Build Entity in the Proposal.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

D.For the purpose of this Part certain words and terms are hereafter defined and shall have the meaning thus ascribed.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.1. - TITLE.This Part shall be known as the Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance of the City of Arcadia.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.2. - HOTEL."Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by
transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel,
bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer
at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.3. - OCCUPANCY."Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof
(whether or not the person entitled to the use or possession actually uses or possesses such room or rooms or portion thereof),
in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use or possess any room or any suite of
connecting rooms as office space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibits, sample or display space shall not be considered
"occupancy" within the meaning of this definition unless the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to
use or possess all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.4. - TRANSIENT."Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of
access, license or other agreement for a period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar
days as full days. The following rules shall apply to this definition:
Any such person so occupying or entitled to occupy a room in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the
period of ninety (90) calendar days has expired. In the event a person exercises or is entitled to occupancy for a
continuous and uninterrupted period of longer than ninety (90) calendar days, he or she shall be deemed a
transient and subject to the tax for only the first ninety (90) calendar days of occupancy and shall cease being a
transient and the tax shall not apply on the ninety-first (91st) day of occupancy and following. However, any break
or interruption in occupancy shall start a new ninety (90) day period subject to the tax.
In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent
to the effective date of this Part may be considered.
Any person who exercises or is entitled to occupancy for a period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days or less
shall be deemed to be a transient for that period, regardless of whether the reservation and/or payment for
occupancy is made directly by the person exercising or entitled to occupancy or by another person. The intent is to
tax the person exercising occupancy or having the entitlement to occupancy of a hotel room.
In the case of a block reservation, a person's employee or agent shall be deemed a transient if that employee orArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank
91 of 1257 08-01-2025, 20:24
agent exercises or is entitled to occupancy of a room for a period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days or less,
regardless of the duration of any block reservation agreement. By way of example, if a corporation enters into a
one-year block reservation agreement with an operator and one of the corporation's employees occupies a room
for ninety (90) calendar days, the employee shall be deemed a transient whose occupancy is subject to the tax,
notwithstanding the fact that the block reservation agreement has a duration longer than ninety (90) calendar days.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.5. - RENT."Rent" means the total consideration charged to the transient, (including but not limited to, room rates, service charges,
parking fees, purchase price, advance registration, block or group reservation charges, assessments, retail markup, commission,
processing fees, cancellation charges, attrition fees, or online booking fees), whether or not received, for occupancy in a hotel
valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property
and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. Nothing in this definition shall be construed to
mean that rent is charged directly or indirectly for occupancy in a hotel when a room is provided to the transient as a compliment
for the operator and where no consideration is charged to or received from any other person. Further, bona fide charges for food
and beverages which are subject to tax under the California Sales and Use Tax Law (Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 6001 et
seq.) shall not be deemed rent subject to the tax imposed by this Part.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.6. - OPERATOR."Operator" means a person who is proprietor of the hotel or any other person who has the right to rent rooms within the
hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, seller, reseller, or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent or booking agent of any type or character, other
than an employee (including, but not limited to, an online travel company), the managing agent or booking agent shall also be
deemed an operator for the purposes of this Part and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Full compliance
with the provisions of this Part by either the principal or the managing agent or booking agent shall, however, be considered to be
compliance by both.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.7. - TAX ADMINISTRATOR."Tax Administrator" means the City Director of Finance, or his or her designee.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.8. - ONLINE TRAVEL COMPANY."Online Travel Company" shall mean any person, whether operating for profit or not for profit, which enables transients to
purchase occupancy in a hotel via the Internet, or by similar electronic means.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.9. - PERSON."Person" shall mean any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock
company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as aArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

unit.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)2661.10. - BLOCK RESERVATION."Block Reservation" shall means an arrangement whereby a person reserves, whether on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, a
room or block/group of rooms for a defined period of time under a written or oral agreement with an operator, intending for such
room(s) to be occupied by that person's employees or agents on an intermittent, periodic or "as needed" basis during that
defined period of time.
(Ord. No. 2292-D, § 1, 4-10-12)DIVISION 2. - IMPOSITION AND RATE2662. - TAX IMPOSED.For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the maximum amount of twelve
percent (12%) of the rent charged to the transient. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is
extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the
time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The
unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing occupancy. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. The proceeds of this tax are
allocated to the City's general fund for governmental expenditures. This chapter may be repealed or amended by the City Council
without a vote of the People of the City of Arcadia. However, as required by California Constitution Article XIIIC (Proposition 218),
voter approval is required for any amendment or provision that would increase the maximum rate or methodology of any tax
levied pursuant to this chapter.

every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall

otherwise facilitates the placement of a sports wager with, any third party, or (c) receives compensation from an online sports
betting operator or other third party for facilitating online sports wagering or for operating an in-person location where online
sports wagers may be placed. Acceptance occurs regardless of the ultimate outcome of the wager and regardless of whether the
sports wager is placed at a physical location within the City, through an electronic application or service while at a physical
location within the City, with a business within the City through the internet or other offsite service, or through any other means.
(Ord. No. 2392, § 1, 11-8-22)2665.3. - OPERATOR."Operator" means any person engaged in the business of accepting sports wagers in the City of Arcadia. "Operator" also
includes any person engaged in the business of operating a location in the City of Arcadia that facilitates online sports wagering or
of operating an in-person location in the City of Arcadia where online sports wagers may be placed.
(Ord. No. 2392, § 1, 11-8-22)2665.4. - SPORTS EVENT."Sports Event" means any physical, athletic, or sporting competition or event, whether professional, collegiate or amateur, on

competitions and similar events. "Sports Event" does not include horse races or horse race meetings.

proposition bets on outcomes related to a sports event even if not part of the competition itself. This definition shall be inclusive
of any system or method of wagering, including but not limited to single-game bets, teaser bets, parlays, over-under, moneyline,
pools, exchange wagering, in-game wagering, in-play bets, proposition bets, straight bets, and fantasy sports pools or
competitions. "Sports Wager" shall also include any fee, charge, membership dues or similar costs imposed by an operator on a
person placing a sports wager or offered by an operator as a condition of, or incentive for, placing a sports wager. Examples
include, but are not limited to, charges for opportunities to place sports wagers at different prices or values or charges for
opportunities to make wagers that otherwise would be unavailable to persons who have not paid the charge.

raffle, sweepstakes, or prize.
Sports wagering gross revenue is determined on a per-reporting period basis, regardless of when the outcome of a
sports wager is subject to determination. For example, if the reporting period is quarterly, and the operator accepts
a sports wager in the first quarter of the year for an event taking place in second quarter of the year, then the
operator shall include the amount as sports wagering gross revenue in its first quarter return. The operator may
then take a deduction when the patron redeems the winnings, which will either be in the second quarter or later.

Public Switched Network (PSN), by means of various technologies, by every person in the City using such services. The
tax imposed by this section shall be at the rate of five percent (5%) of all charges made for such services and shall be
paid by the person paying for such service. There is a rebuttable presumption that communications services, which
services are capable of terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, and which are billed to
a billing or service address in the City, are used, in whole or in part, within the City's boundaries, and such services are
subject to taxation under this chapter. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the
service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax.
"Mobile Telecommunications Service" shall be sourced in accordance with the sourcing rules set forth in the Mobile
Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Section 124). The Tax Administrator may issue and disseminate to
communication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this Part, sourcing rules for
the taxation of other communication services, including but not limited to post-paid telecommunication services,
prepaid telecommunication services, and private telecommunication services, provided that such rules are based upon
custom and common practice that further administrative efficiency and minimize multi-jurisdictional taxation (e.g.,
Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement).As used in this section, the term "communications services" shall not include "private mobile radio service" [as definedin Part 20.3 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations], or "private mobile service" [as defined in 47 U.S.C.A. Section
332(d)(3)], which is not interconnected with the PSN. As used in this section, the term "communications services" shall
include, but shall not be limited to charges for: connection, reconnection, termination, movement, or change of
communications services; late payment fees; detailed billing; central office and custom calling features (including but
not limited to call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and three-way calling); voice mail and other messaging
services; directory assistance; access and line charges; universal service charges; regulatory, administrative and other
cost recovery charges; local number portability charges; and text and instant messaging. "Communication services"
shall not include digital downloads such as, music, ringtones, games, and similar digital products.As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kindor nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the communications services.
The Tax Administrator, from time to time, may issue and disseminate to communications service suppliers that are
subject to the tax collection requirements of this Part, an administrative ruling identifying those communications
services that are subject to the tax of subsection (a) above. This administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise
an existing tax methodology as stated in this Part, or increase an existing tax except as allowed by California
Government Code Section 53750(h)(2), as it may be amended from time to time.
To facilitate the uniform interpretation and application of similar ordinance provisions in other local jurisdictions in the
state, the Tax Administrator may, prior to issuing and disseminating a sourcing rule or an administrative tax ruling,
submit his or her proposed sourcing rule or administrative tax ruling to a Municipal Organization for review and
comment, according to the rules and procedures of that Municipal Organization, or its successor organization.
To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of communications services subject to tax under this section, any service
user, upon proof to the Tax Administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or city
on such communications services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such
tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed
to the City under this section.

and records kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not
created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper apportionment of taxable
and non-taxable charges. If the service supplier offers a combination of taxable and non-taxable services, and the charges are

and non-taxable services.

charge therefor, from taxation). Only to the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the
prior version of the statute (or interpretation) shall remain applicable; for any application or situation that would not require voter
approval or would not result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable
to the maximum possible extent.

business facilities; (d) the growth of the City's tax base through increased property values and consumer purchasing; (e) the
reduction of the need for and costs of welfare and other remedial programs; (f) the reduction of urban ills, such as crime,
attributable in part to inadequate economic opportunities; (g) the stability and diversification of the City's economy; (h) the

development within the City will reflect the local community's needs and objectives and will be environmentally optimum with

problems of statewide concern.2751.2. - DEFINITIONS.Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms defined in this chapter shall have the following meanings:

results of the investigation required by Section 13.6, finds that the vehicle or vehicles described in said application may
be operated upon the restricted streets set forth in the application without undue damage to the roadway,
foundations, surfaces and structures of such restricted street or streets and that such proposed use is not inconsistent
with the public health, safety, welfare and convenience, he may, if good cause appears therefor, issue a permit upon

caused by such vehicle operating on said street, the sum of two cents per ton for each ton of vehicle and load carried
therein times each 528 feet or part thereof of such restricted street upon which said vehicle is operated. Payment of
such sum is necessary to protect such restricted streets from the actual damage and injury which will result from the

deposit shall be based upon the estimated fees which will become due during the first month of permittee's use of
restricted streets pursuant to the permit. Upon completion or termination of the use permitted by said permit the
deposit shall be applied to the sum due from the permittee for the previous month's operation or use and any excess
shall be returned to the permittee by the City Treasurer. In the event the amount of the deposit is less than the amount

days after the date the City Manager notifies the applicant in writing of his decision on the said application, file with the
City Clerk a written notice of appeal to the City Council from such decision. Before accepting for filing any such notice of
appeal the Clerk shall charge and collect a fee of Twenty Five dollars ($25.00). Upon receipt of said notice of appeal and

reasonable and safe upon certain streets. The prima facie speed limit on those streets may be increased by resolution of the City
Council, and shall be effective when appropriate signs giving notice thereof are erected upon the street. Such prima facie speed
limits shall not thereafter be revised except upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey. (Former Section was repealed by

laws and City regulations adopted pursuant thereto, controlling or regulating the parking of vehicles in streets, and at a location
and in a manner where vehicles may be lawfully left unattended for any period of time.3231.3. - SAME. EXCEPTION.The term to park shall not include the standing or leaving of any vehicle in a street:
Pursuant to the order or demand of any law enforcement officer.
Pursuant to any traffic control signal or device.
The temporary standing or stopping of a vehicle at locations where such standing or stopping is lawful for the sole
purpose of receiving or discharging passengers or merchandise.
The temporary standing or leaving of a vehicle in the customarily traveled portion of any street.DIVISION 2. - DECLARATION OF NEED3232. - DECLARATION.The Council does hereby find and determine as follows: That the City is confronted with serious and unique traffic problems.
That the City is primarily a residential community, surrounded by other residential, business, manufacturing and recreational
centers. That this fact, coupled with the presence of large centers of entertainment in the midst of and in close proximity to the
City, causes vehicular traffic to, from, through and within the City at times to attain dimensions totally disproportionate to the size
and population of the City. That on frequent occasions the population within the City is increased as much as five-fold in the
space of two hours, and tens of thousands of motor vehicles enter or pass through portions of the City within an hour, with the
result that abnormal traffic problems result which cannot be met or solved by the mere increase in law enforcement personnel.
That any hindrance of the flow of such vehicular traffic causes delay, traffic congestion, accidents and imminent peril to both life
and property within the City. That the sale of any commodity from a vehicle or to a person in a vehicle on any major traffic arterial
in said City peculiarly adds to the local traffic congestion, delay and hazard to life and property. That strict enforcement of traffic
laws alone is insufficient to cope with the situation. That it is not possible to employ sufficient police officers adequately to control
such unique traffic problems, not only because of the present manpower shortage, but particularly because of the fluctuating
volume of such vehicular traffic. That it is therefore necessary to remove and prevent, so far as is possible, all factors which
contribute to or cause any interference with or retardation of the movement of vast numbers of motor vehicles in the City.DIVISION 3. - REGULATIONS3233. - SELLING AND DISTRIBUTING ON STREETS RESTRICTED.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

requires that the State Geologist delineate Special Studies Zones to encompass all potentially and recently active faults in
California that constitute a potential hazard to structures from surface faulting. The Act requires cities and counties to exercise
specified approval authority with respect to new real estate developments and structures for human occupancy. In compliance
with the provisions and intent of the Act, the City of Arcadia hereby declares the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones Map of the
State Geologist that affects the City of Arcadia is by this reference incorporated herein as though fully set forth.3702. - DEFINITIONS.For the purpose of this Chapter, certain words and terms are hereby defined as follows:

Any improvements or additions to a structure for human occupancy, other than a single family wood framed
dwelling not exceeding two stories that exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the present market value of said structure
as listed on the latest equalized assessment roll, or by an independent appraiser.
Special Study Zone. An area of limited extent centered on a positioned fault. The zone boundaries are positioned
approximately six hundred sixty (660) feet on either side of a fault. The Special Studies Zones are believed by the
State Geologist to warrant special geologic investigations to confirm the presence or absence of hazardous faults.
Structure for Human Occupancy. Any structure that is habitually or primarily occupied by humans.3703. - OFFICIAL MAPS.The Official State Maps delineating the Special Studies Zones affecting the City of Arcadia shall be maintained by the Planning
Department. Copies of said maps shall be made available to the public at a cost.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

;hn0; (Chapter 8 added by Ord. 1900 adopted 1-3-89)CHAPTER 9. - ALARM SYSTEMS—LAW ENFORCEMENT SECURITY ALARM SYSTEMS3900. - FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.The City of Arcadia finds and determines that the regulation of security alarm systems and the control of false security alarms
are necessary to promote the health, welfare and safety of the people. Many security alarm systems currently in use either
mechanically malfunction, or are not operated properly by their users, causing an increase in false security alarm reports, thereby
constituting a hazard and wasted time for peace officers, communications personnel and the public in general. The City Council
determines and finds that the high rate of "false security alarms" is extreme, and that the remedies set forth in this Chapter,
including without limitation cost assessments, are necessary to address and remedy this problem and its negative impact on the
services of the City and the taxpayers of the community.3901. - DEFINITIONS.For the purpose of this Article, the following definitions will apply:
"Security alarm system" is any device designed for the detection of an unauthorized entry on or into any building,
place, or premises or for alerting others of the commission of an unlawful act and which, when activated, emits a
sound or transmits a signal to indicate that an emergency exists, to which police personnel are expected to
respond.
"Security alarm business" shall mean any person, firm or corporation conducting or engaging in the business of
selling, leasing, maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving, removing, installing or monitoring a
security alarm system in or on any building, place, premises or vehicle.
"Security alarm agent" shall mean any person who is self-employed or employed by a security alarm business,
whose duties include any of the following: selling, maintaining, leasing, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing,
moving or installing a security alarm system in or on any building, place, premises or vehicle.
"Audible security alarm" is a device designed to activate upon an unauthorized entry, or attempted entry, into a
structure and which sounds an audible signal on the premises.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

"Direct dial telephone device (automatic dialing device)" is any device interconnected to a voice grade telephone
line and which is programmed to select a predetermined telephone number and which transmits by prerecorded
voice message or code signal an emergency message indicating a need for an emergency response.
"False security alarm" shall mean the activation of a security alarm system necessitating response by the Arcadia
Police Department where an emergency situation for which the security alarm system was designed or used does
not exist. Alarms that are activated by a person or persons who have a reasonable belief under the particular
circumstances that activation was necessary shall not be deemed "false security alarms." "False security alarm"
shall not include a security alarm system activated as a result of authorized servicing, testing, maintenance,
adjustments, alterations or installations thereof, provided that the respective permitee or authorized agent thereof
notifies the Arcadia Police Communications Center as required pursuant to Section 3905(B) prior to
commencement of any of the aforesaid activities. Security alarms that result from natural causes, acts of God, or
power failures beyond the control of permitee are not deemed to be "false security alarms."
"Person" shall mean any individual, partnership, corporation or other entity.
"Residential" means premises used as dwelling units, which includes without limitation apartments and lodging
houses.

and other related goals to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community.
The public property of the City of Arcadia is maintained and utilized for a variety of purposes related to said

The regularly scheduled temporary nature of election sign placement is incidental to the aforementioned goals of the
City and utilization of public property.
Property and facilities located within the public right-of-way, such as utility poles, benches, hydrants, bridges, sidewalks
and similar structures are not by tradition or designation a forum for communication by the general public, and the
Council wishes to preserve these structures for their intended purposes, which is the safe, efficient and pleasant
movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and operation of utility systems.
The regulations and prohibitions specified in this Section are necessary to preserve the public right-of-way and public

tree, shrub, tree stake or guard, railroad trestle, electric light or power or telephone or telegraph or trolley wire pole, or wire
appurtenance thereof or upon any fixture of the fire alarm or police telegraph system or upon any lighting system, public bridge,
drinking fountain, lifesaving equipment, street sign or traffic sign, or upon any other object on public property.
Exception Regarding Election Signs in Certain Residential Zones. The prohibition set forth in Section 4912.1 shall not
apply to temporary election signs in the parkway area of the following residential zones of the City: R-M, R-O, R-1,
R-2, and R-3 subject to the requirements set forth in the following Section 4912.1(b).
Requirements for Exception to Apply. The above exception shall apply subject to the following requirements:
"Parkway area" is defined as that portion of the public right-of-way located between the face of the curb and
the front property line.
The signs shall not protrude, encroach, or in any way extend over the curb or sidewalk area.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

impairment, visual distraction, or in any other manner endanger vehicles or pedestrians.
Concerning violations of the above, City Enforcement officials shall provide notice to the responsible parties
including the adjacent resident affording them an opportunity to correct the problem. Notice shall be in writing
and/or by personal contact in a manner that is reasonably calculated to correct the problem and create

be removed by the Police Department or the Department of Public Works. The person responsible for any such illegal posting
shall be liable for the cost incurred in the removal thereof and the Department of Public Works is authorized to effect the
collection of said costs. Any sign, handbill or related item removed by the City may be considered abandoned if it is not retrieved
within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of such removal, and may be disposed of by the City without liability to any person.4912.3. - EXCEPTION.

Municipal Code shall:
Work with customers in the City to recycle and educate customers about the need to recycle and inform all
applicable customers of their obligation to recycle pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 42649.2 and other
applicable law, including SB 1383. Within ninety (90) days of the issuance of the hauler's business license, the
hauler shall submit to the Public Works Services Director a strategy and methodology for increasing diversion and
recycling within the City, which includes a discussion of how the hauler will ensure applicable customers are aware
of their obligation to recycle pursuant to applicable law;
Achieve annual diversion rates, as provided under applicable state law, for all commercial solid waste as defined in
the City's Source Reduction and Recycling Element including, but not limited to, varieties of paper, plastics, glass, as
well as wood, yard and other greenwaste, manure, organic waste, and construction and demolition debris,
collected or removed within the City;
Report to the City all materials considered diverted or recycled resulting in source reduction, recycling, composting
and/or transformation from the commercial and industrial solid waste stream by using the diversion formula set
forth in Section 5130.1(d);
In calculating the annual diversion rate achieved, each hauler shall utilize the following formula and definitions
incorporated by reference from Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Article 6.1 Solid Waste Generation Study,
Section 18722 et seq. The following equation defines the "Integrated Waste Management (AB 939) Generation-
Based Diversion Quantification Methodology":

(f)
(g)Diversion Rate (%) = Diversion Tons_______Generation Tons
 
A hauler may only claim diversion tonnages resulting from source reduction, recycling, composting, and transformation
activities. Diversion shall be quantified on an "avoided disposal" basis. The overall calculated annual diversion tonnage to be
reported to the City by a hauler may include a combination of the diversion quantities achieved by the customers serviced by the
hauler, and the tonnage diverted by the hauler. Diversion quantities achieved by a customer may include those resulting from the
customer's internal source reduction practices, and may further include recycling tonnage given to an independent third party
recycler. Diversion quantities and practices shall be subject to audit by an independent third party approved by the Public Works
Services Director, at the cost and expense of the hauler.
A hauler may petition the City to use a different calculation methodology to determine diversion tonnage upon showing, based
upon substantial evidence, that the above methodology cannot be accomplished due to lack of available data, or other
circumstances. The approval of the City's Public Works Services Director shall be required for any alternative method of
calculation.
A hauler that does not achieve at least an annual 50% diversion rate may petition the City for continuation of its
commercial solid waste permit if the hauler provides to the Public Works Services Director substantial evidence, in
a form and content deemed satisfactory by the Public Works Services Director, that shows 1) the disposed solid
waste does not consist of readily recyclable materials, or 2) refusal by the hauler's customers to cooperate in
recycling programs, including identifying which customers are required to recycle pursuant to Public Resources
Code Section 42649.2 and other applicable law and refuse to do so, or 3) the cost of recycling is unreasonably
prohibitive, or 4) other reasons for failure to achieve at least an annual 50% diversion rate (e.g., space limitations,
refusal by business to report internal business recycling, etc.), and by demonstrating "good faith" in implementing
other waste reduction and recycling programs. The City's Public Works Services Director may approve the
continuation of the permit if the Director finds that there is a reasonable basis for doing so, and that the hauler has
demonstrated "good faith" in implementing other waste reduction and recycling programs. The City may require an
alternative annual diversion goal and impose additional conditions for the continuation of the commercial solid
waste permit.
A hauler can demonstrate "good faith" waste reduction and recycling programs by 1) providing documentation of
other program(s) that the hauler is implementing, and/or 2) participating in cooperative waste reduction and
recycling programs with the City.
Comply with all relevant provisions of Part 4.
Each permitted commercial hauler servicing an entity shall provide a recycling container for the customer's source
separated recyclables at no additional charge to the commercial customer upon request of the commercial
customer and in compliance with Part 4.

to verify the accuracy of all records and reports made to the City. The City Council may by resolution adopt such administrative
procedures as necessary detailing the auditing procedure and costs of such audits. The hauler shall pay to the City the cost of the
audit.
(Ord. No. 2383, § 1(Exh. A), 11-2-21)5130.4. - PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.If a commercial hauler fails to reach the diversion rates as specified by Section 5130.1(c), then the City shall, consistent with
Arcadia Municipal Code Section 6216.7, consider action to suspend or revoke the applicable business license permit or direct
nonrenewal of the permit and/or application, or direct the imposition of civil penalties and fines pursuant to a duly promulgated
ordinance to implement the provisions of this Part 3 of the Code.

accord a major outdoor facility with significant space and value to the community, the opportunity to conduct certain
entertainment type events as defined as authorized by Text Amendment No. 94-002 (AMC 9273.1.15), subject to the attainment of
a special permit and compliance with the following Code Sections which are necessary to allow these uses in view of the unique
outdoor characteristics of the contemplated events and the need to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community, and
specifically the neighborhoods surrounding the entertainment site in the S-1 Zone, consistent with the following findings:
Historically, the primary use of SART is seasonal horse racing. These permit requirements and related zone use
changes are promulgated in recognition of the continuance of this use with a reasonable transition and
accommodation to additional uses that enhance the current underutilized status of SART property with uses that
are consistent with the capabilities of that property, and not inconsistent with the residential qualities that are an
integral part of Arcadia's community character.
The primary control that is necessary to allow certain entertainment events at SART relates to noise. In this regard,
the City Codes and regulations applicable to this subject make no reference to content and are promulgated as
content neutral.
The City determines that noise regulations and controls are to create a situation that allows sound that is
satisfactory to the audience in attendance at entertainment events without intruding on residential neighborhoods.
Outdoor concerts have been the source of problems throughout their history including disturbance to
neighborhoods, frustration to entertainment event audience attendees and performing artists. These problems
have been adequately addressed by reasonable governmental controls seeking a workable balance amongst these
interests and enhanced by full cooperation between the participants and regulators.
Amplified noise is part of the current operation of SART with regard to certain events including horse racing. The
goal of this Code and related regulations is to assure retention of the character of the community in view of
amplified sound concomitant to entertainment activities.
City goals are to provide the best sound for all events and to insure appropriate sound quality balanced with
respect for nearby residential neighborhoods.
City sound amplification provisions and management shall not sanction inadequate sound systems or vary sound
quality or volume based on the message being delivered by performers. City shall assure sound amplification
sufficient to reach all listeners within the defined concert grounds.
City shall promulgate and apply all ordinance and regulation provisions applicable to noise controls in a manner
that does not cause prior restraint on the content of any entertainment event, nor in any way effect the message of
the performance.
SART officials and entertainment promoters associated with SART have acknowledged the purpose and goals set
forth herein, the contemplated techniques and management of noise controls to be applied, and the time duration
of this Division with the full understanding that no vested rights or a continuation of entertainment event permits
shall accrue to them or other interested parties, and that the renewal of any permit procedures is totally within the
discretion of the Arcadia City Council.
SART and their promoters have committed to a certain type of programming that is generally described as familyArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

(b)oriented as opposed to what is generally termed "rock concert." It is acknowledged that this commitment was not
imposed by Arcadia and the City government is not imposing content-related provisions to specify forms and types
of entertainment.
In relation to finding (j), it is determined that the nature of SARTs proposal was related to approval of the land use
additions to the S-1 Zone as set forth in Ordinance No. 2011 adding outdoor entertainment events as permitted use
in that zone.
It is further determined that for purposes of the transitional nature of the new use, the pilot program nature of this use as
sanctioned by the sunset clause provisions, and the need to balance the needs and goals of SART with those of the community,
adherence to SARTs commitment as to the type of entertainment is an integral part of the new land use and therefore the
requirements of the permit process.6417.1. - DEFINITION AND APPLICATION."Event" shall be a specific program, show, concert, performance, festival or similar occurrence. "Outdoor entertainment
events" includes any entertainment oriented event held at the Santa Anita Race Track open to the general public and held when
on premises horse racing is not in session. Events must be a permitted use according to the zoning regulations of the property as
defined in Arcadia Municipal Code Sections 9273.1.14 and 9273.1.15. No use as set forth is permitted unless there is compliance
with all of the provisions of this Division 7. "Permittee" includes Santa Anita Race Track, and the promoter-procedures of a specific
event.6417.2. - PERMIT REQUIRED. APPLICATION/CITY COUNCIL REVIEW.Every separate outdoor entertainment event shall be held and open to the general public only with an approved
outdoor entertainment event permit issued by the City of Arcadia for that event. Subject to the requirements set forth
below, outdoor entertainment event permits for the Santa Anita Race Track property shall be issued by the Business
License Officer upon approval by the City Manager, who can condition any approval.
Before granting a permit to conduct an outdoor entertainment event at the Santa Anita Race Track property, the City
will evaluate the complete application to assure that the event will not be detrimental to public health, safety and
welfare. The City may establish any conditions to the issuance of the permit, in addition to the conditions set forth
below, which are deemed reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
Upon receipt of all information necessary to process an outdoor entertainment permit application, it shall be
transmitted to the City Council, and placed on the next Council meeting agenda under City Manager for purposes of
review and comment, including review and direction with regard to the conditions imposed by staff.
Consistent with the pilot program goals, all events recommended for approval by staff shall proceed with whatever
recommendations are added by Council, if consistent with applicable ordinance requirements. However, if Council as a
body through majority vote expresses a negative view of the particular permit, such vote shall be noted for purposes of
the official record upon future consideration of the continuation or repeal of the land use change and permit ordinance
authorizing outdoor entertainment activities and permits at SART.6417.2.1. - COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION PROCESS.Prior to the granting of any outdoor entertainment permit, staff shall provide written materials related to the
application to interested neighborhood representatives, and conduct a noticed public meeting with the neighborhood
to receive their views, and input with regard to noise, traffic, site regulations and other related permit factors.
Representatives of all involved City departments including the Police shall participate.
Notice shall include specific letter notice to those individuals who addressed the City Council at the public hearings onArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

the neighborhoods represented by those speaking at the referred to Council meeting. In addition, notice shall be
mailed to property owners within one thousand (1,000) feet of the boundaries of SART.6417.3. - HOURS, DURATION, NUMBER OF EVENTS. TYPE.Entertainment events as authorized by Arcadia Municipal Code Sections 9273.1.14 and 9273.1.15 and as defined in Section
6417.1 are subject to the following permit requirements:
In no case shall there be in excess of thirty (30) event days per year. The yearly period shall commence upon the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this Division and terminate on October 1, 1995.
Weekday events are those that fall between six (6:00) p.m. on Sunday and six (6:00) p.m. on Thursdays, excluding
holiday weekend Mondays that are National legal holidays. No weekday events shall occur beyond the time frames
set forth in this Section, except for three (3) days to be designated by permittee on which days the time limit
applicable to weekend events shall apply.
Weekend events shall include Friday and Saturday events plus Sunday when Monday is a national legal holiday.
These events shall be conducted between the hours of nine (9:00) a.m. and eleven (11:00) p.m.
Conduction during the above permitted hours means that no aspect of the entertainment activity and/or
performance itself including noise attributable to the specific activity shall occur before or after the prescribed
times.
Those events conducted at SART by nonprofit organizations as defined at Arcadia Municipal Code Section 9273.1.14
shall not be counted as part of the day requirements set forth above. In all other respects, the provisions of this
Division shall apply to approved nonprofit organization events, unless exempted by the City Manager upon a
showing of good cause.
Consistent with the specific commitment of SART and their promoter, they shall submit at the earliest time possible
prior to the granting of any permit, a complete list and description of each and every event that they contemplate
for scheduling during the ordinance period. This submittal shall be to determine consistency with the commitment
for family oriented entertainment as opposed to what is generally described as "rock concerts." Based on the
following special finding, it is acknowledged that the City's intent is not to impose specific definitional criteria to
musical products or entertainment.
Finding and City Determination/Indemnity. Santa Anita is not a traditional outdoor entertainment forum for the
events that are contemplated by the land use amendment approved by the City Council. It was not built or
designed for that purpose. Surrounding neighborhoods were constructed and inhabited, partly in consideration
of SART's long history as a seasonal horse racing site. Accordingly, in recognition of changing trends and the
needs of SART, their significant investment and the underutilized status of subject property, they requested a
text amendment to the Zoning Code to expand their uses on an experimental basis before adoption of a
permanent ordinance. In recognition of these and other factors set forth in this Division, and in view of the
types of problems that can evolve from the contemplated uses such as excessive noise, crowd control
problems, traffic and potential law enforcement problems, all of which have been documented throughout the
United States, SART has committed to forms of entertainment that best meets these goals. Accordingly, they
will abide by any determination by City that a submitted entertainment request is not eligible for the application
process. This includes their commitment to hold Arcadia harmless, and to defend and indemnify the City, its
officers, agents and employees, from any action that arises out of such a determination.6417.4. - TRAFFIC.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

(f)The Arcadia Police Department will evaluate the application submitted for all "events" and apply any necessary regulations and
traffic control requirements. No outdoor entertainment event permit will be issued without review and approval from the Arcadia
Police Department for traffic control with written concurrence by the permittee with regard to applicable conditions.6417.5. - VENDING.All business activity of vending and/or offering for sale, merchandise, souvenirs, drinks, food and services will require a
business license according to Section 6211. Fees for business license are based on Part 2, Sections 6220 through 6220.47. All food
vendors will display a valid Health Department Certificate.6417.6. - NOISE, REGULATORY GUIDELINES AND PERFORMANCE AGREEMENT.Permittees shall acknowledge on the permit form their understanding that the previous exemption of City noise requirements
for amplified sound in the S-1 Zone as set forth at Arcadia Municipal Code Section 4620.1 has been repealed and that other
sections have amended the City Noise Code all of which are affixed to the permit as part of the conditions of such permit. "Sound"
regulations shall be prepared by the City Manager and City Attorney with approval by the City Council to supplement and
implement the provisions and goals of this Division. They shall include sound control guidelines to administer and manage all
aspects of noise/sound controls and management. Additionally, permittee shall as a condition precedent to the granting of an
outdoor entertainment permit, execute a performance agreement in a form as approved by the City Attorney to commit to the
following:
The City Manager shall appoint a Noise Monitor (sound technicians or technicians) to act as its direct agent for
purposes of noise control on the premises of the permittee. Permittee shall fund the cost of the monitor, shall
allow the Monitor full access to the applicable sound system (including sound or mixing board) with the right and
ability to control same, subject to the following:
Control shall relate to violations of the City Noise Ordinance including the nuisance provisions and sound
regulations.
The City, its officer, agents and employees shall be held harmless by permittee with regard to any losses,
claims, suits or liability that arise out of the actions of the City Noise Monitor, and shall agree in writing to the
satisfaction of the City Attorney to indemnify the City with regard to any such actions.
Permittees shall provide City with a staging plan at least thirty (30) days in advance of the event. This plan shall
show the location of the stage or performance area, and details of the sound system and amplification to enable
review by the City Noise Monitor. Permittees shall review this plan with the City and adhere to reasonable
conditions as recommended by the City with regard to noise mitigation in relation to the staging plan. These
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the location of the performance area, the location and/or utilization
of sound mitigation structures or devices, and configuration of the stage and program area.
Permittees agree to allow Arcadia Police personnel as designated by the Chief of Police to have full access to the
property to assist the City Noise Monitor.
Permittees agree to pay for or provide whatever communication, devices, aides, and equipment and instruments
that may be necessary to effectively monitor and control the noise system as prescribed by the City.
Permittees shall agree to cooperate in good faith with the City and to abide by any other reasonable conditions for
noise control as may be set forth in the performance agreement.
Compliance with Subsections (a) through (e) of this Section is required regardless of whether a performance
agreement is executed. Violation is subject to the following Section 6417.7 and 6417.8.6417.7. - PENALTIES. MISDEMEANOR VIOLATIONS.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

designees shall be submitted to City in advance of any permitted event.
Any documented problem as determined by the City Manager or the Manager's designee shall justify the imposition of new or
revised conditions applicable to any event for which a permit has already been issued, or any future event at which the City
Manager or his designee determines that similar problems may arise.6417.9. - APPLICATION PROCESS, FEES AND DEPOSIT.Each separate entertainment event as defined by the above Code Sections shall require a separate application and permit.

5-20-06; amended by Ord. 2235 adopted 1-15-08; amended in its entirety by Ord. 2260 adopted 8-19-09)6418. - FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.The City of Arcadia is authorized, by virtue of the State Constitution and Section 51031 of the Government Code, to regulate
massage therapists by conditioning the issuance of a license to engage in the business of massage on reasonable standards
relative to their skill and experience, and to regulate owners and operators of massage therapy businesses to ensure the safety of
clients receiving massage therapy.
While the City Council recognizes that section 4612 of the Business and Professions Code and section 51034 of the
Government Code gives those individuals who are certified pursuant to chapter 10.5 of the Business and Professions Code the
right to practice massage, those sections also gives the City the right to adopt reasonable business licensing and health and safety
requirements for massage establishments and businesses, including requiring a conditional use permit (CUP) to operate.
The City Council finds and determines that the standards contained in this division pertaining to massage therapy business
activities are necessary to protect the public health and safety and the personal safety of massage therapists.
The City Council further finds that the public health and safety are best served by the adoption of an ordinance providing for
regulation of massage therapy business activities in a manner that is consistent throughout the City of Arcadia, and that is

 CHAPTER 7. - ADULT BUSINESS PERFORMER LICENSEFootnotes:--- (13) ---
(Chapter 7 of Article 6 added by Ord. 2103 adopted 5-18-99)6700. - PURPOSE.It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to provide for the licensing of adult business performers in order to promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City. The goals of the performer licensing provisions are: (1) to protect
minors by requiring that all performers be over the age of eighteen (18); (2) to assure the correct identification of persons
performing in adult businesses; (3) to enable the City to deploy law enforcement resources effectively; and (4) to detect and
discourage the involvement of crime in adult businesses by precluding the licensing of performers with certain sex-related
convictions in a set time period. It is neither the intent nor the effect of these regulations to invade the privacy of performers or to
impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor the effect of
these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to communicative materials or to deny access by the distributors or
exhibitors of adult businesses to their intended lawful market. Nothing in these regulations is intended to authorize, legalize, or
permit the establishment, operation, or maintenance of any business, building, or use which violates any City Ordinance or any
statute of the State of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness, obscene or
harmful matter, or the exhibition or public display thereof.
The definitions contained in the Arcadia Municipal Code, specifically those found in Division 9 shall govern for purposes of
these regulations.6701. - ADULT BUSINESS PERFORMER LICENSE.No performer shall be employed, hired, contracted for or otherwise retained in an adult business to participate in or
give any live performance displaying specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities without first having a valid
adult business performer license issued by the City.

 CHAPTER 8. - ADULT BUSINESS LICENSEFootnotes:--- (14) ---
(Chapter 8 added by Ord. 2211 adopted 11-15-05)6800. - PURPOSE.The intent of this chapter is to regulate uses which, because of their very nature, are believed to have any of the recognized
significant secondary effects on the community which include, but are not limited to: depreciated property values and increased
vacancies in residential and commercial areas in the vicinity of adult oriented businesses, interference with residential,
commercial and industrial property owners' enjoyment of their property when such property is located in the vicinity of adult
oriented businesses due to increased crime, debris, noise and vandalism; higher crime rates in the vicinity of adult oriented
businesses; and blighting conditions such as low-level maintenance of commercial premises and parking lots which thereby have
a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will
not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult oriented businesses. In approving
the regulations contained in this article, the city council has reviewed detailed studies, reports and letters prepared by other
jurisdictions and its own staff with respect to the detrimental social, health and economic effects on persons and propertiesArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

(Ord. No. 2330, § 1, 11-3-15)7554.2. - PURPOSE.The State Legislature has found:
That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands;
That the continuation of California's economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of
water for future uses;
That it is the policy of the State to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of
this valuable resource;
That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation
and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection,
and replacing ecosystems lost to development;
That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water efficient; and
That Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount
reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or
unreasonable method of use.
Consistent with these legislative findings, the purpose of this Ordinance is to:
Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and
efficient use of water;
Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new
construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires cross-sector
collaboration of industry, government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible;
Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes in the
City;
Use water efficiently without waste by setting a Maximum Applied Water Allowance as an upper limit for water use
and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount;
Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies; and
Encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water,
such as implementing a tiered-rate structure; and
Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can
improve California's environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals. Such landscapes
will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes. Consistent with the findings and purposesArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

1.of this Ordinance, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:
Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that
increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen
production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits.
Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers
and pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.
Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate
appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment.
Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and
locally sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion.
Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate adapted non-natives
and avoiding invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of
action.

When, as determined by the City, 100 percent onsite retention of the SWQDv is technically infeasible, partially
or fully, the infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID Plan. The technical infeasibility may result
from conditions that may include, but are not limited to:The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible toamend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration
or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv onsite.
Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten feet of surface grade;
Locations within 100 feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water;
Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern;
Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;
Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/ or nature of the project would
create significant difficulty for compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement.
If partial or complete onsite retention is technically infeasible, the project Site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the
portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained onsite. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the
design specifications provided in the Permit. Additional alternative compliance options such as offsite
infiltration may be available to the project Site. Alternative compliance options are further specified in the
County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works Stormwater Best Management Practices Design and
Maintenance Manual. The project Site should contact the Director to determine eligibility and obtain approval.
In all cases, the project Site must comply with all relevant provisions of the Permit.
The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered onsite must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant
loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant specific benchmarks as required per the
Permit. Flow through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall
intensity of:
0.2 inches per hour, orThe one year, one hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetalmap, whichever is greater.
A Multi-Phased Project may comply with the standards and requirements of this section for all of its phases by:
designing a system acceptable to the City to satisfy these standards and requirements for the entire Site
during the first phase, and
implementing these standards and requirements for each phase of Development or Redevelopment of the
Site during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to the extent
necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. For purposes of this section, "Multi-Phased
Project" shall mean any Planning Priority Project implemented over more than one phase and the Site of a
Multi-Phased Project shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat or manage
stormwater runoff in connection with the Development or Redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2374, § 2, adopted February 16, 2021, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 7910—7920. Inasmuch as §§ 7915—7920

areas for camping obstructs the intended uses for the public at large, contributes to blight, and can cause damage to public
property. This Chapter is intended to avoid unsafe and potentially disorderly conditions, unsanitary and unhealthful conditions,
and the degradation or destruction of open spaces and facilities within the City.

3109.4.4.2.1. Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Permit Fees. Every applicant for a permit to install, alter, or repair a swimming
pool, spa, hot tub or part thereof, shall state in writing on the application form provided for that purpose, the character of work
proposed to be done and the amount and kind in connection therewith, together with such information pertinent thereto as may
be required.
A fee for each swimming pool, spa or hot tub, including for plumbing and electrical systems, shall be paid to the City in an
amount established by City Council Resolution.
Any person who shall commence any swimming pool, spa or hot tub work for which a permit is required by this Code without
having obtained a permit therefore shall, if subsequently permitted to obtain a permit, pay double the permit fee fixed by
resolution of the City Council for such work, provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to emergency work when it
shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Building Official that such work was urgently necessary and that it was not
practical to obtain a permit therefore, before the commencement of the work. In all such cases, a permit must be obtained as
soon as practical to do so, and if there be an unreasonable delay in obtaining such permit, a double fee shall be charged.
3109.4.4.2.1.1. Reinspections. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of
work for which inspection is called is not complete or when required corrections have not been made.
This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with
the requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspection before the job is ready for reinspection.
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide
access on the date for which the inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring approval of the City. To obtain
reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefore in writing upon the form furnished for that purpose and pay the
reinspection fee in accordance with the amount set by City Council Resolution. In instances where reinspection fees have beenArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

Wall Height Bracing. The wall height may be reduced by bracing elements connected to the floor or roof. Horizontal
spacing of the bracing elements and wall anchors shall be as required by design but shall not exceed six (6) feet on
center. Bracing elements shall be detailed to minimize the horizontal displacement of the wall by the vertical
displacement of the floor or roof.
Parapets. Parapets and exterior wall appendages not conforming to this Chapter shall be removed, or stabilized or
braced to ensure that the parapets and appendages remain in their original position.
The maximum height of an unbraced unreinforced masonry parapet above the lower of either the level of tension anchors or
roof sheathing, shall not exceed one and one-half (1 1/2) times the thickness of the parapet wall. If the required parapet height
exceeds this maximum height, a bracing system designed for the force factors specified in Table 23-P of the Building Code for
walls shall support the top of the parapet. Parapet corrective work must be performed in conjunction with the installation of
tension roof anchors.
The minimum height of a parapet above the wall anchor shall be twelve (12) inches.
EXCEPTION: If a reinforced concrete beam is provided at the top of the wall, the minimum height above the wall anchor may be
six (6) inches.Veneer.Unreinforced masonry walls which carry no design loads other than their own weight may be considered as veneer
if they are adequately anchored to new supporting elements.
Veneer shall be anchored with approved anchor ties, conforming to the required design capacity specified in the
Building Code and placed at a maximum spacing of twenty-four (24) inches with a maximum supported area of two
(2) square feet.

The bed joints of the outer wythe of the masonry shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the
adjacent bricks in the same wythe. The head joint opposite the loaded end of the test brick shall be carefully excavated and
cleared. The brick adjacent to the loaded end of the test brick shall be carefully removed by sawing or drilling and excavating to
provide space for a hydraulic ram and steel loading blocks. Steel blocks, the size of the end of the brick, shall be used on each end
of the ram to distribute the load to the brick. The blocks shall not contact the mortar joints. The load shall be applied horizontally,
in the plane of the wythe, until either a crack can be seen or slip occurs. The strength of the mortar shall be calculated by dividing
the load at the first crack or movement of the test brick by the nominal gross area of the sum of the two bed joints.1

Existing Anchors
The test apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall at a minimum distance of the wall thickness from the anchor
tested. Existing wall anchors shall be given a preload of 300 pounds prior to establishing a datum for recording elongation. The
tension test load reported shall be recorded at 1/8 inch relative movement of the anchor and the adjacent masonry surface.
Results of all tests shall be reported. The report shall include the test results as related to the wall thickness and joist orientation.
Combined Shear and Tension Bolts
Combined shear and tension bolts embedded in unreinforced masonry walls shall be tested using a torque calibrated wrench
to the following minimum torques:
1/2 inch diameter bolts 40 foot lbs.
5/8 inch diameter bolts 50 foot lbs.
3/4 inch diameter bolts 60 foot lbs.
 
All nuts shall be installed over malleable iron or plate washers when bearing on wood and heavy cut washers when bearing on
steel.
See Appendix Chapter 1, Uniform Code for Building Conservation.
Pointing
The old mortar should be cut out, by means of a toothing chisel or a special painter's grinder, to a uniform depth of 3/4", or
until sound mortar is reached. Care must be taken not to damage the brick edges. All dust and debris must be removed from the
joint by brushing, blowing air or rinsing with water.
Mortar mix shall be Type "S" or "N" proportions as called for in the construction specifications. The tuck-pointing mortar
should be pre-hydrated to reduce excessive shrinkage. The proper pre-hydration process is as follows:
All dry ingredients should be thoroughly mixed. Only enough clean water should be added to the dry mix to produce a damp,
workable consistency which will retain its shape when formed into a ball. The mortar should stand in this dampened condition for
one to one and one-half hours.
The joints to be tuck-pointed should be dampened, but to ensure a good bond, the brickwork must absorb all surface water.
Water should be added to the pre-hydrated mortar to bring it to a workable consistency (somewhat drier than conventional
mortar). The mortar should be packed tightly into the joints in thin layers (1/4" maximum). Each layer should become "thumbprint
hard" before applying the next layer. The joints should be tooled to match the original profile after the last layer of mortar is
"thumbprint hard."
Relaying of BrickArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank
629 of 1257 08-01-2025, 20:24
Replacement bricks must match the originals with respect to size, color and texture where exposed. A tuck-pointing toothing
chisel should be used to cut out the mortar which surrounds the affected units. Power driven impact tools are not allowed. Once
the units are removed, all of the old mortar shall be carefully chiseled out and all dust and debris shall be swept out with a brush.
If used brick is to be relayed, it shall be cleaned of all old mortar. The brick surfaces in the wall shall be dampened before new
units are placed, but the masonry should absorb all surface moisture to ensure a good bond. The appropriate surfaces of the
surrounding brickwork and the replacement brick should be buttered with mortar. The replacement brick should be centered in
the opening and pressed into position. The excess mortar should be removed with a trowel. Pointing around the replacement
brick will help to ensure full head and bed joints. When the mortar becomes "thumbprint hard," the joints shall be tooled to
match the original profile.

effects of earthquakes on tilt-up concrete wall buildings designed under the building codes in effect prior to January 1, 1976. Such
buildings have been categorized based on past earthquakes, as being potentially hazardous and prone to significant damage,
including possible collapse, in a moderate to major earthquake.
The provisions of this Part are minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of
loss of life or injury on both subject and adjacent properties and will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent
earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these standards. The requirement for compliance with thesep

standards does not preclude the utilization, at the building owner's option, of more extensive strengthening method that might
further prevent or limit loss of life or injury or building damage. This Part shall not require existing electrical, plumbing,
mechanical or fire safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or property.
This Part provides systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of tilt-up concrete wall buildings
based on the current use of the buildings. Priorities, time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings
are required to be structurally analyzed and strengthened for seismic resistance. Where the analysis determines structural
deficiencies, this Part requires the buildings to be strengthened or demolished.8921. - SCOPE.The provisions of this Part shall apply to all buildings designed or built under building codes in effect prior to January 1, 1976,
which, on the effective date of this Part have tilt-up concrete walls as defined in this Part.

placed in one such rating classification by the department. The total occupant load as determined by UBC Section 3302(a) of this
Code for the entire building plus the occupant load of any adjacent building which interconnects with the subject building or uses
the subject building for exiting purposes shall be used to determine the rating classification.8924. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.The owner of each building within the scope of this Part shall cause an investigation of the existing construction and a
structural analysis to be made of the building by a civil or structural engineer or architect licensed by the State of California, and if
the building does not meet the minimum standards specified in this Part, the owner shall cause it to be structurally altered to
conform to such standards or cause the building to be demolished.
The owner of the building within the scope of this Part shall comply with the requirements set forth in this Part by submitting
to the department for review within two hundred seventy-five (275) days after the service of the order the following:A structural analysis, subject to approval by the department within the two hundred seventy-five (275) day time period,which demonstrates that the building meets the minimum requirements of this Part; orA structural analysis and plans for the proposed structural alterations of the building necessary to comply with theminimum requirements of this Part; or
Plans for the demolition of the building.
After plans are submitted and approved by the department, the owner shall obtain a building permit, commence and complete
the required construction or demolition within the time limits set forth in Table 89-I. These time limits shall begin to run from the
date the order is served in accordance with Section 8925.1 and 8925.2 of this Part. Vacating a building shall not be deemed as
complying with the requirements of this Part.8925. - ADMINISTRATION.8925.1. Service of Order. When the department determines that a building is within the scope of this Part, the owner shall
comply with Section 8924 of this Code. If the owner does not comply, the department shall issue an order as provided in Section
8925.2 to the owner of each building with the minimum time periods for service of such orders set forth in Table No. 89-J. The
minimum time period for the service of such orders shall be measured from the effective date of this Part.
8925.2. Contents of Order. The order shall be in writing and may be given either by personal delivery thereof to the owner or
by deposit in the United States mail in a sealed envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the owner as shown on the last
equalized assessment roll. Service by mail shall be deemed to have been completed at the time of deposit in the post office. The

and concisely the reasons for appeal. Each appeal shall be accompanied by a filing fee as set forth by resolution of the City
Council.
8925.4. Recordation. At the time that the department serves the aforementioned order, the department shall file with the
office of the County Recorder a certificate stating that the subject building is within the scope of Part 2 - "Earthquake Hazard
Reduction in Existing Tilt-up Concrete Wall Buildings" of this Code. The certificate shall also state that the owner thereof has been
ordered to structurally analyze the building and to structurally alter or demolish it when the department determines the building
is not in compliance with Part 2 of this Code.
If the building is either demolished, found not to be within the scope of this Part or is structurally capable of resisting minimum
seismic forces required by this Part as a result of structural alterations or an analysis, the department shall file with the office of
the County Recorder a Certificate terminating the status of the subject building as being classified within the scope of Part 2
"Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Tilt-up Concrete Wall Buildings" of this Code.
8925.5. Enforcement. If the owner of the subject building fails to comply with any order issued by the department pursuant to
this Part within any of the time limits set forth in Section 8924, or within any additional time limits as may have been granted by
the Board, the department may order that the building be vacated and subsequently ordered to be demolished in accordance
with the provisions of Section 8924 of this Code. The Building Official shall have the authority to grant two one (1) year extensions
in cases of extreme hardship.8926. - ANALYSIS AND DESIGN.8926.1. Wall Panel Anchorage. Concrete walls shall be anchored to all floors and roofs which provide lateral support for the
wall. The anchorage shall provide a positive direct connection between the wall and floor or roof construction capable of resisting
a horizontal force equal to thirty percent (30%) of the tributary wall weight for all buildings and forty-five percent (45%) of the
tributary wall weight for essential buildings, or a minimum force of two hundred (200) pounds per linear foot of wall, whichever is
greater. The required anchorage shall be based on the tributary wall panel assuming simple supports between floor and roof or
between floor and floor.
EXCEPTION. Alternative design may be approved by the Building Official when justified by well established principles of
mechanics.
8926.2. Special Requirements for Anchors. Wall anchors shall be provided to resist out-of-plane forces, independent of existing
shear anchors. The wall anchor systems shall be capable of developing yield in the body of the anchor or the system without
inducing brittle failure to the concrete to which the anchors are attached.
EXCEPTION. Existing cast-in-place shear anchors may be used as wall anchors if the tie element can be readily attached to the
anchors and if the engineer or architect can establish tension values for the existing anchors through the use of approved as-built
plans or testing, and through analysis showing that the bolts are capable of resisting the total shear load while being acted upon
by the maximum tension force due to earthquake. Criteria for analysis and testing shall be determined by the Building Official.
Expansion anchors are not allowed without special approval of the Building Official. Attaching the edge of plywood sheathing
to steel ledgers is not considered as complying with the positive anchoring requirements of this Code, and attaching the edge of
steel decks to steel edges is not considered as providing the positive anchorage of this Code unless testing and/or analysis are
performed which establish shear values for the attachment perpendicular to the edge of the deck.
8926.3. Development of Anchor Loads into the Diaphragm. Development of anchor loads into roof and floor diaphragms shall
comply with Section 2337(b)9.C. of the UBC.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank
633 of 1257 08-01-2025, 20:24
In wood diaphragms, anchorage shall not be accomplished by use of toe nails or nails subject to withdraw, nor shall wood
ledgers, top plates or framing be used in cross-grain bending or cross-grain tension. The continuous ties required by Section
2337(b)9.C. of the UBC shall be in addition to the diaphragm sheathing.
Lengths of development of anchor loads in wood diaphragms shall be based on existing field nailing of the sheathing unless
existing edge nailing is positively identified on the original construction plans or at the site.
At reentrant corners, continuity collectors may be required for existing return walls not designed as shear walls, to develop
into the diaphragm a force equal to the lesser of the rocking or shear capacity of the diaphragm. Shear anchors for the return wall
shall be commensurate with the collector force. If a truss or beam other than rafters or purlins is supported by the return wall, an
independent secondary column is required to support the roof or floor members whenever rocking or shear capacity of the
return wall is governing.
8926.4. Girder Anchorage at Support. In addition to the anchorage required per Section 8926.1. girder to pilaster connections
shall be verified for the tributary wall anchoring load per Section 8926.1 of this Code, considering the wall as a two-day slab.
Adequacy of existing lateral confinement of vertical girder anchor at the top of the pilasters shall be verified per Section
2607(k)3.D. of the UBC. If the confinement is inadequate, additional exterior confinement shall be provided. A continuous load
path from the pilaster, through the girder and to the diaphragm shall be verified.
EXCEPTION. The requirement for additional confinement and/or adequate strength of existing girder anchor bolts at the top of
the pilaster may be waived if the girder is anchored directly to the walls immediately adjacent to the pilaster, or to the pilaster, for
the total lateral force such that the existing girder anchor bolts are by-passed without causing shear failure at the top of the
pilaster.
8926.5. Crack and Damage Repairs, Evaluation of Existing Structural Alterations.
The engineer shall report any observed structural conditions and structural damage that have imminent life safety effects on
the buildings and recommend repairs. Evaluations and repairs shall be reviewed and approved by the department.
The engineer shall also evaluate the effects of alterations such as openings cut in existing wall panels without a permit, that
may present immediate life safety hazard and correct when necessary.
8926.6. Miscellaneous. Existing mezzanines relying on the tilt-up walls for vertical and/or lateral support shall be anchored to
the walls for the tributary mezzanine load. Walls depending on the mezzanine for lateral support shall be anchored per Section
8926.1, 8926.2 and 8926.3.
EXCEPTION. Existing mezzanines that have independent lateral and vertical support need not be anchored to the walls.
Existing interior masonry or concrete walls not designed as shear walls, that extend to the floor above or to the roof
diaphragm shall also be anchored for out-of-plane forces per Section 8926.1, 8926.2 and 8926.3 of this Code. In the in-plane
direction, the walls may be isolated or shall be developed into the diaphragm for a lateral force equal to the lesser of the rocking
or shear capacity of the wall, or the tributary shear but not exceeding the diaphragm capacity.8927. - MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION.All materials permitted by this Code, including their appropriate allowable stresses and those existing configurations of
material specified in Part 1 of this Code, may be utilized to meet the requirements of this Part.8928. - INFORMATION REQUIRED ON PLANS.8928.1. - GENERAL.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

cross-ties and collectors. Existing nailing, anchors, ties and collectors shall also be shown on the plans if these are part
of the design, and these structural elements need to be verified in the field.At elevations where there are alterations or damage, details shall show roof and floor heights, dimensions of openings,location and extent of existing damage, and proposed repair.
Typical wall panel sections with panel thickness, height, location of anchors shall be provided.
Details shall include existing and new anchors and the method of development of anchor forces into the diaphragm
framing; existing and/or new cross-ties; existing and/or new or improved support of roof and floor girders at pilasters
or walls.8928.3. - ENGINEER'S OR ARCHITECT'S STATEMENT.The responsible engineer or architect shall state on the approved plans, the following:
I am responsible for this building's seismic strengthening design in compliance with the minimum seismic resistance
standards of Part 2 of this Chapter.
The Registered Deputy Inspector, required as a condition of the use of structural design stresses requiring continuous
inspection, will be responsible to the Building Official as required by Section 306(a) of the UBC.8929. - REQUIRED BUILDING MAINTENANCE.Every building within the scope of this Part which has been analyzed to demonstrate compliance or structurally altered to
comply with the minimum earthquake standards in this Part shall be maintained in conformity with the requirements of this Part
in effect at the time of such analysis or structural alteration.8929.1. - VIOLATIONS/PENALTIES FOR DISREGARDING DEPARTMENT ORDERS.Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code to the contrary, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to
maintain, use or occupy any building within the scope of this Part which does not meet the minimum earthquake standards
specified in this Part.
Any person who violates or causes or permits another person to violate this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person
includes an owner, lessor, sublessor, manager or person in control of a building subject to this Part. This term shall not include
any person who is merely a tenant or other individual occupying any dwelling unit, efficiency dwelling unit, guest room or suite in
a building.
The legal owner of a building is that person, firm, corporation, partnership, or other entity whose name or title appears on the
record with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office, as well as all successors or assignees of these persons.
EXCEPTION: This Section shall not apply if alteration or repair work has commenced in order to bring the building into
compliance with the requirements of this Part, and such work is proceeding in accordance with the time limits set forth in order
of the department or determination of the board.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

(Ord. No. 2388, Exh. A, 7-19-22)9102.01.170 - Multifamily Objective Development Standards. The purpose of these design standards is to provide the public, building and design professionals, and
decision-makers with objective criteria for eligible residential development in the City. The intent is to provide clear
design direction that enhances an area's unique character and sense of place, respects existing neighborhood
compatibility and privacy, and ensures a high-quality living environment.
 Since 2017, the Governor has signed into law multiple housing bills, including Senate Bill 35 and Senate
Bill 330 which provide for streamlined, ministerial approval processes for eligible multifamily residential development
(two or more residential units), subject to certain conditions which may include affordability requirements, and where
consistent with objective zoning and design standards.
 The provisions of this chapter apply to all newly constructed residential projects, in all zones, that qualify
for streamlined, ministerial processing per the Housing Accountability Act (HAA), and which meet the definition of
"housing development projects" under California Government Code §69988.5(h)(2). These include multifamily housing
with two or more units, and mixed-use projects with up to two-thirds of the project. Eligible residential projects shall
comply with all objective development standards, City policies, thresholds of significance, zoning regulations, and
design standards as established in the General Plan and the Arcadia Development Code.
 Residential projects seeking a modification(s) to any development standards set forth in the Arcadia
Development Code shall not be eligible for streamlined, ministerial processing per SB 35.
 Up to three (3) objective development standards from all of the
individual sub-items under each category may be waived for any eligible mixed-use residential project without theArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

 Projects must meet objective development standards in this Division, in addition to all
pertinent sections of the Arcadia Development Code and the California Building Code (CBC). If there is any conflict
between these objective standards and existing City and/or State requirements, the more restrictive objective
standard applicable to the project shall apply.
 In the event that a development standard is found to be unenforceable, invalid or unconstitutional by
the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this Division, and all other development standards will remain enforceable.

 In 2017, the Governor signed into law multiple housing bills, including Senate Bill 35 and SB 330 which
provide for streamlined, ministerial approval processes for eligible multifamily and mixed-use residential development,
subject to certain conditions which may include affordability requirements, and consistent with objective zoning and
design standards.
 The provisions of this chapter apply to all newly constructed residential projects, in all zones, that qualify
for streamlined, ministerial processing per the Housing Accountability Act (HAA), and which meet the definition of
"housing development projects" under California Government Code §69988.5(h)(2). These include mixed-use projects
with up to two-thirds of the project dedicated to residential square footage. Eligible residential projects shall comply
with all objective development standards, City policies, thresholds of significance, zoning regulations, and design
standards.
 Residential projects seeking a modification(s) to any development standards set forth in the Arcadia
Development Code shall not be eligible for streamlined, ministerial processing per SB 35.
 Up to three (3) objective development standards from all of the
individual sub-items under each category may be waived for any eligible mixed-use residential project without the
requirement for an additional application. The applicant must provide an explanation as to why the development
standard is not applicable or cannot be achieved. The waiver is subject to review and approval by the Director or
designee. These decisions are not appealable.
 Projects must meet objective standards in this Division, in addition to all pertinent sections
of the Arcadia Development Code and the California Building Code (CBC). If there is any conflict between these
objective standards and existing City and/or State requirements, the more restrictive objective standard applicable
to the project shall apply.
 In the event that a development standard is found to be unenforceable, invalid or unconstitutional by
the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this Division, and all other development standards will remain enforceable.
  
  
Existing mature trees shall be preserved and incorporated into development proposals.
Decks and balconies shall be recessed and/or incorporated into the massing of the building, rather than
protruding out of the building, to enhance privacy.
Where applicable, active commercial uses, including retail, restaurant, and personal services shall be located on
the ground floor fronting the sidewalk.
Where applicable, private amenities, such as plazas and open space shall be located in the interior of the site or
otherwise away from the street.
 Building form, massing and façade articulation facilitates the distinction
of individual units, or groups of units, through varied heights, projections, setbacks, and recesses. Materials and
colors emphasize changes and hierarchy in building form.
 For projects over two stories in height, portions of the upper stories shall be recessed at least two feetArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

Promote mixed use residential, retail, and office development at locations that will support transit use; and
Promote commercial and mixed-use development that will foster and enhance surrounding residential
neighborhoods by improving access to a greater range of facilities and services.
 The Commercial Business District zone is intended to promote a strong
pedestrian-oriented environment and to serve community and regional needs for retail and service uses, professional
offices, restaurants, public uses, and other similar and compatible uses. Residential uses are permitted above ground
floor commercial or adjacent to a commercial development. Both uses must be located on the same lot or on the same
project site. This zone implements the General Plan Commercial designation.
 The Mixed Use zone is intended to provide opportunities for commercial and residential mixed-
use development that takes advantage of easy access to transit and proximity to employment centers, and encourages
pedestrian activity. A wide range of integrated commercial and residential uses are appropriate. Residential uses are
permitted above ground floor commercial or adjacent to a commercial development, or as standalone projects if
affordable housing units are provided. This zone implements the General Plan Mixed Use designation.

 The C-M zone is intended to provide areas for a complementary mix of light
manufacturing businesses, minor vehicle service and repairs, and support office and retail uses. A wide range of small-
scale industrial and quasi-industrial uses with minimal impact to surrounding uses are appropriate. Retail uses are
limited to business services, food service, and convenience goods for those who work in the area. Residential uses are
limited to various properties north of Downtown as allowed under the Downtown Mixed Use Overlay Zone. This zone
implements the General Plan Commercial/Light Industrial designation.

the strict application of other sections of this Division. The RF Overlay Zone provides the option to build a residential
project in a commercial zone. Given the state of commercial development throughout the City and region, there are
locations that may benefit from this flexibility; also, a residential project may serve as a catalyst for other types of
development in the surrounding area. The RF Overlay Zone is intended to maintain compatibility between residential
and non-residential uses on adjacent lots through development standards and design guidelines. The standards in this
section are applicable to stand-alone residential projects only; all other projects are subject to the requirements of the
underlying zoning designation.
 In addition to the land use regulations of the underlying zone, [residential developments are allowed]
by-right when 20 percent or more of the units are affordable to lower income households on sites identified as part of
the Residential Flex Overlay Zone. By-right development will not require a CUP, planned unit development permit, or
other discretionary review or approval except for the City's Subdivision requirements and Objective Development
Standards. Refer to Section 9103.15.030 of the Code for additional incentives and concessions for affordable housing
development.

 Off-site parking spaces may be relied upon to serve commercial
uses, provided a shared-parking study is completed by the applicant/developer and approved by the Director. In the
event the proposed land use is for a multi-tenant and/or mixed use development or involves a Specific Plan or Planned
Development Permit, the Director may also authorize the preparation of a parking study to determine the required
number of parking spaces as an alternative to the number of off-street parking as outlined in Tables 3-5 through 3-8
(Off-Street Parking Requirement) and other applicable provisions of this Section, subject to the following conditions:
Off-street parking standards determined by a parking study shall be approved, modified, and/or denied in
accordance to the use classification and/or required planning permit for the proposed use. If there are no planning
permits required for the proposed use but the Director has determined a parking study is required, then the review
and approval of parking study shall be processed pursuant to the requirements of Section 9107.05 (Administrative
Modification).
The City shall maintain the right to select a consultant, which will be paid for by the applicant.
The study shall have been undertaken and completed by a traffic engineer registered by the State of California and
shall bear the stamp of that engineer.
If the required parking is determined by such a parking study, future modification or improvement to the parking
area which impacts the parking space layout, configuration, and/or number of stalls or if any such building or
structure in the project is enlarged or increased in capacity by floor area or seats, or at such time that a usage
requiring a higher number of parking spaces than an existing or previous use is applied, a new parking study
pursuant to this Section shall be provided showing that the existing and/or proposed parking is adequate for such
expansion and/or increased usage. Alternative to a revised parking study, at the time of such expansion or
increased usage, the applicant may comply with all provisions of this Section in effect at the time of the application.
 Except as otherwise provided in this Section, for each separate use, a site with multi-tenants, or a
combination of principal uses in any one facility, the development shall provide the aggregate number of parking
spaces required for each separate use unless a parking study has been prepared and approved in compliance with this
Chapter or except as provided for in Subsection 9103.07.090 (Shared/Joint Use and Off-site Parking).
 A Parking Plan with an associated Parking and/or Traffic Study may replace the
required parking for each land use on a property that has multiple uses at a commercial center. The Plan must provide
justification for a specific parking rate and format, subject to review and approval of the Review Authority pursuant to
the requirements of Section 9107.05 (Modification).
 Educational uses that serve children shall be required to submit a
parking plan that indicates the location of pick-up and drop-off area (separate from the driveway aisle) subject to the
review and approval of the Review Authority pursuant to the requirements of Section 9107.19 (Site Plan and Design
Review).
  
Parking spaces shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner that does not preclude direct and free
access to stairways, walkways, elevators, any pedestrian way, and fire safety equipment.
Vehicle parking (and access thereto) shall be provided on a permanently paved surface.
When required off-street parking spaces are provided on a separate lot from the building or land use, there shall be
recorded in the office of the County Recorder against the lot on which such parking spaces are provided, a
covenant in the form approved by the City Attorney that the owner of such lot will continue to maintain such
parking spaces as long as the use in the building or the land use requiring such parking is maintained.

(Ord. No. 2375, § 4(Exh. A), 4-6-21)9103.07.090 - Shared/Joint Use, O�-site Parking, and In-Lieu Parking. The Director shall be the designated Review Authority for the review and approval of any proposal shared,
joint use, on or off-site parking arrangements, or In-lieu parking fee, unless parking is included in an application
requiring approval of another Review Authority. In these cases, the ultimate Review Authority per Division 7 (Permit
Processing Procedures) shall be the Review Authority for the shared, joint use, off-site parking agreement, or In-lieu
payment.
 Where it can be demonstrated that two or more land uses can
effectively share common parking facilities due to the nature of the uses and distinctly different demand for parking, or
where off-site parking is proposed to meet parking requirements, then an application may be filed for such parking
arrangement. Such application shall include a parking study that identifies the parking demand of all subject land uses
and that clearly demonstrates how and why parking facilities can be shared.
The following categories of development shall be eligible to use shared use and/or off-site parking arrangements to
meet parking requirements:
Nonresidential new construction.
Additions to existing structures, rehabilitation of existing structures, or changes in use or occupancy in existing
structures.
New and existing residential uses are not eligible to use shared use or off-site parking arrangements.
 For any new developments that are within the Central Business District or Downtown
Mixed Use zones, the property owners may make an in-lieu payment for future construction, maintenance and
operation of public off-street parking instead of providing off-street parking spaces.
  
Off-site parking spaces may be relied upon to serve commercial uses, provided a shared parking study is completed
by the applicant/developer and approved by the Director. The parking study shall be prepared by a registered
traffic engineer and shall specifically analyze the parking demand for each use proposing to share the parking, each
use's hours of operation, and other related issues of all involved uses.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

1.No joint use or shared facility shall be located more than 1,500 feet from the use it is intended to serve unless
located within the Downtown Parking Overlay.
Shared use parking standards are based on the assumption that patrons will use a single parking space for more
than one destination and that one parking space will be open and available for short-term parking to serve many
different uses which may have different peak hours.
 In granting a request for shared/joint use
or off-site parking, the Review Authority shall make all of the following findings:
There is clear and convincing evidence that peak hour parking demand from all uses does not coincide and/or the
uses are established in a way that the hours of operation are different for the various businesses or uses.
There is adequate parking provided for all participating users.
The shared/joint use or off-site parking arrangement will be an incentive to, and a benefit for, the nonresidential
development.
Adjacent or nearby properties will not be adversely affected by the shared/joint use or off-site parking.
The parking arrangement is consistent with the General Plan and all requirements of this Code.
 In-lieu fees, at the owner's option, may be paid in a lump sum or in annual installments, and may
be adjusted annually for inflation. If paid annually, the first annual payment of an in-lieu fee shall be due as a condition
of occupancy, and subsequent payment shall be made per the agreement the City enters into with the owner. In-lieu
payment under the In-Lieu Parking program shall be used for establishing such public parking funds, as established by
the City Council.
  
All joint, shared, and off-site parking arrangements shall be required to enter into an agreement with the City and
recorded with the Office of the County Recorder, requiring the parking to be operated on a nonexclusive basis, to
be open and available to the public for shared use, short-term parking during normal business hours.
All In-Lieu parking arrangements shall be required to enter into an agreement with the City.
 In the event of a change in use, a new application shall be filed or the existing agreement amended to
the satisfaction of the Director.

Valet parking shall be subject to review of hours of operation, circulation and other pertinent impacts. All proposals
for valet parking shall be accompanied by a parking study, prepared by a registered traffic engineer, that addresses
circulation impacts, operational characteristics of the use, parking space size and configuration and other issues
deemed necessary by the Director.
Valet parking shall be provided on the same site as the business for which the valet parking is being approved. In
the event the location for the valet parking is off-site of the business, the provisions in this Section regulating off-
site parking shall also be applicable.
  
Because of the unique characteristics of valet parking facilities, parking space size shall be determined on a case-
by-case basis and not necessarily subject to the standards listed in this Section.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

landscaping alive, attractive and free of disease. It is the intent of this Section to preserve and enhance the appearance
and visual appeal of the community.
 Landscaping requirements outlined in this Section shall be applicable to all new development and to
improved nonconforming lots when the nonconforming lot is to be modified by a change of more than 20 percent in
the square footage of structures. The Director may approve modifications to these standards on nonconforming lots
where the revised site design does not allow for full compliance with these provisions due to the space and dimensions
created by those structures and other improvements being retained.
 Landscaping of parking areas shall be provided and maintained according to the
general standards of Section 9103.09 (Landscaping), as well as the standards within this subsection. Proposed parking
lot landscaping as required by this Section shall be reviewed and approved by the Review Authority through a Site Plan
Design Review, pursuant to the requirements of Section 9107.19 (Site Plan and Design Review) of this Development
Code.
 Within parking lots, landscaping shall be used for shade and climate control, to enhance
project design, and to screen the visual impact of vehicles, light pollution, and large expanses of pavement.
Landscaping materials shall be provided throughout the parking lot area using a combination of trees, small shrubs,
and groundcover. A comprehensive landscape and irrigation plan shall be submitted for review and approval in
compliance with Section 9103.09 (Landscaping).

residents of large retail developments protects the health and welfare of the citizens of the City of Arcadia because it encourages
them to use parking spaces provided at the retail developments, and reduces harmful impacts on neighboring City and residential
streets.
The voters of the City of Arcadia support a policy that requires large retail developments to provide off-street self parking for
their patrons, visitors, employees, and residents free of charge for any length of time and without any restriction or requirement
to obtain parking validation of any kind from a retail establishment in the development.
 For the purpose of imposing a prohibition on charging for parking, a Large Retail
Development shall mean any development that includes a planned integrated commercial development comprising
more than two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of Gross Leasable Area to be used for retail restaurant,
entertainment, and movie theater purposes.
 Off-street parking spaces provided for all Large Retail
Developments in the City, regardless of the zoning of the Large Retail Development property, shall be provided free of
charge to all patrons, visitors, employees, and residents without time limits, and they shall not be required to obtain
parking validation from a commercial establishment within the Large Retail Development in order to enjoy free self
parking at the Large Retail Development property.
 Valet Parking is a service provided by a Large Retail Development where customers arriving at the Large
Retail Development can drop off their cars to be parked and have their cars returned to them upon departure, for a fee
or validation. A Large Retail Development may require Valet Parking validation from a commercial establishment or
charge a fee for Valet Parking, as long as the Valet Parking service uses no more than 10% of the total number of off
street parking spaces of the Large Retail Development.

side yards may be installed with artificial turf. Artificial turf shall not be installed within 10 feet of a sidewalk or
within 20 feet from the curb if there is no sidewalk.
 Artificial turf is not permitted within any parkway areas.
 To be used in the front or street-side yard, artificial turf must meet minimum standards for
materials, installation, and maintenance.
 Artificial turf must have a minimum eight-year no-fade warranty as issued by the
manufacturer; be cut-pile infill and made from lead-free polypropylene, polyethylene or a blend of such fibers
on a permeable backing; and, have a minimum blade length (pile height) of 1.5 inches, or as determined by the
Director as manufacturing processes are updated. Nylon-based or plastic grass blades are not permitted. The

all existing plant material and top three inches of soil in the installation area; placement of filter fabric or
synthetic porous material over compacted and porous crushed rock or other comparable material below the
turf surface to provide adequate drainage; and, the area must be sloped and graded to prevent excessive
pooling, runoff, or flooding onto adjacent property. Artificial turf areas must be sufficiently drained to live
planting areas to provide complete infiltration of runoff. Artificial turf must be separated from live planting
areas by a barrier such as a mow strip or bender board to prevent mixing of natural plant materials and
artificial turf. Artificial turf must be permanently anchored with nails and glue, and all seams must be nailed, or
sewn, and glued, with the grain pointing in a single direction.
 Artificial turf must be maintained in a green, fadeless condition; free of weeds, stains, debris,
tears, holes, depressions, ruts, odors, and looseness at edges and seams. Damaged or worn areas in the
artificial turf surface must be repaired or removed and replaced in a manner that results in consistent
appearance with the existing artificial turf. The artificial turf surface must be replaced once it is unable to be
maintained as required. Vehicle parking on artificial turf is prohibited.

necessary, be protected by installation of atmospheric or pressure type vacuum breakers. At least one hose bibb shall
be located each 100 linear feet, starting with one hose bibb at the front wall. Hose bibbs, wherever possible, shall be
located in planting beds. In no case shall hose bibbs be located where they will interfere with pedestrian or vehicular
circulation.Section 9103.11 - Signs9103.11.010 - Purpose.Because of the need to protect and enhance the City's unique character (including special places and features such as a
vibrant Downtown, the urban forest, attractive streetscapes, diverse parks, historic buildings and places, and
entertainment destinations), to protect public safety and property values, and to promote economic development and
tourism through enhanced aesthetic appeal, the Council finds that proper sign control is an important governmental
interest. The intent of the standards in this Section is as follows:
Provide each sign user an opportunity for adequate identification while guarding against the excessive and confusing
proliferation of signs by appropriately regulating the time, place, and manner under which signs may be displayed.
Preserve and enhance the community's appearance by regulating the type, size, location, quality, design, character,
scale, color, illumination, and maintenance of signs.
Encourage well-designed signs that attract and invite rather than demand the public's attention.
Encourage the design of signs that complement the structures and uses to which they relate and that are harmonious
with their surroundings.
Ensure freedom of expression for sign uses, including noncommercial speech, by maintaining a content-neutral
approach to sign regulation.
Enhance the safety of motorists and pedestrians by minimizing the distraction of intrusive signs, as well as to protect
the life, health, property, and general welfare of City residents and visitors.
Provide a review process for signs to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Section.9103.11.020 - Applicability. This Section regulates signs, as defined in this Section, that are placed on private property or on
property owned by public agencies other than the City and over which the City has zoning authority.
 The regulations in this Section shall apply to all signs in all zones that come within the regulatory scope as
defined in Subsection A, above, unless specifically exempted. Sign Permits shall be required in compliance with Section
9103.11.120 (Procedures for Sign Permits, Exemptions, and Revocations). In addition, the provisions of Municipal CodeArticle VIII (Building Regulations) relating to building and electrical codes, fees, penalties, and a method of enforcementshall also apply. Applications for Sign Permits that comply with all of the applicable requirements of this Section, and
other applicable laws, shall be granted. Signs approved in conjunction with any other application shall be consistent
with this Section, unless modified by a discretionary permit. Where approval of a Conditional Use Permit, Minor Use
Permit, Modification, Site Plan and Design Review, or Variance has been obtained, any applicable conditions of that
approval shall supersede the requirements of this Section.
 A Sign Permit shall be required for all signs, including change of copy allowed under the
provisions of this Chapter. Only signs that comply with all of the applicable provisions of this Chapter shall be granted.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

G.Content of a noncommercial message shall not be considered when any required Sign Permit application is reviewed.
Content of a commercial message shall be considered only to the extent required to determine whether the sign is an
on-site sign. See Section 9103.11.120 (Procedures for Sign Permits, Exemptions, and Revocations).
 An existing legally allowed sign that does not conform to the requirements of this Section shall
be deemed a nonconforming sign and shall be subject to the requirements of Section 9103.11.160 (Nonconforming
Signs).
 Sign regulations contained in an adopted specific plan document shall not be less restrictive than the
regulations in this Section. If the adopted specific plan does not provide regulations for a particular sign type or
situation, the requirements of this Section shall prevail.9103.11.030 - General Provisions.The policies, rules, and regulations stated in this Section apply to all signs subject to compliance with this Section.
 No person shall erect, re-erect, construct, maintain, enlarge, alter, change copy, repair, move,
improve, remove, convert, or equip any sign or sign structure, or paint a new wall sign, in the City, or cause or permit
the same to be done, contrary to, or in violation of, any provision of this Section.
 Interpretations of the requirements of this Section shall be exercised in light of the City's
content neutrality policy. Where a particular type of sign is proposed in a permit application, and the type is neither
expressly allowed nor prohibited by this Section, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a "structure" as defined in the
California Building Code, then the Director shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application based on the
most similar sign type that is expressly regulated by this Section.
 It is the City's policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner that is content neutral with
respect to both noncommercial and commercial messages. For the purposes of this Section, a content-neutral
regulation is a so-called "time, place, or manner" regulation, which, as the name suggests, does no more than place
limits on when, where, and how a message may be displayed or conveyed.
 Signs authorized by this Section are allowed to carry noncommercial messages in lieu of any
other commercial or noncommercial messages. Substitution of messages may be made without an additional
permitting process unless a building permit is required. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the
contrary within this Section. The purpose of this provision is to prevent an inadvertent favoring of commercial speech
over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial
message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signs on a parcel, nor does it affect the
requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly constructed.
 Rules and regulations concerning the non-communicative aspects of
signs (e.g., number, type, location, size, height, illumination, spacing orientation, etc.) stand enforceable independently
of any permit or review process.
 Address signs are exempt from the provisions of this Section and are required to comply with Municipal
Code Section 9266.2.8.11 (Address Numbers) in Article III (Public Safety).
 Signs shall not be displayed without the consent of the legal owner of the
property, or the designated agent, on which the sign is mounted or displayed. For purposes of this regulation, "owner"
means the holder of the legal title to the property and all parties and persons holding a present right to possession,
control, or use of the property.9103.11.040 - Exempt Signs.The signs listed in this Section are exempt from the permit requirement and do not count toward the total display areaArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

Only one sign advertising properties for sale or lease shall be allowed per property per street frontage. Signs shall
be limited to a total height of six feet, with a maximum face area size of six square feet in residential zones and 24
square feet in non-residential zones. For new commercial and industrial developments, the maximum face area is
32 square feet.
Primary sign may have one secondary attached sign not to exceed one square foot, and one brochure box.
The sign may be placed in a yard, in a window, or on a wall.
All signs shall be removed within 14 days after the sale, lease, or rental that has been completed. For those
properties that continuously advertise properties for lease, such as a commercial center or an office building, such
signs shall not be required to be removed but shall be integrated into the overall site and building design.
Signs shall only be posted on the subject property for sale, lease, or rent.
  
 On-site traffic control signs and signs providing directions to
specific areas including, but not limited to, building entrances, parking facilities, and onsite facilities may be displayed.
Such signs shall have a maximum area of four square feet and a maximum height of four feet.
 Signs on approved vending machines.

 The City prohibits the construction, erection, or use of off-site signs displaying
off-site commercial messages (i.e., billboards) other than those that legally exist in the City, or for which a valid permit
has been issued and has not expired, as of the date on which this provision was first adopted. The City adopts this
policy in compliance with California Government Code section 65850, California Business and Professions Code
Sections 5354(a) and 5408.3 (both effective January 1, 2003). Permits shall not be issued for off-site signs displaying off-
site commercial messages that violate this policy, and the City will take immediate abatement action against signs
constructed or maintained in violation of this policy. The Council affirmatively declares that it would have adopted this
policy even if it were the only provision in this Section. The Council intends for this off-site sign policy to be severable
and separately enforceable even if other provisions of this Section may be declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, invalid, or unenforceable. This provision does not prohibit agreements to relocate
existing, legal off-site signs, as encouraged by California Business and Professions Code Section 5412. Existing off-site
commercial signs are considered nonconforming signs and are regulated by Section 9103.11.160 (Nonconforming
Signs).

Sections 65915 through 65918, offering incentives for the development of affordable housing for low-income, moderate-income,
and senior citizen households, as well as housing developments for foster youth, disabled veterans, homeless persons, and
college students. Where regulations are not specifically addressed in this Section or where conflicts exist between these
provisions and the provisions of Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918, the provisions of the Government Code, as
they may be amended over time, shall apply.
(Ord. No. 2390, § 4(Exh. B), 9-6-22)9103.15.020 - Density Bonus.Density bonus refers to a density increase over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density established by this
Development Code and in the Land Use and Community Design Element of the General Plan as of the date of application by the
developer, and is in accordance with the affordability levels proposed in the project, consistent with density bonus law provisions
contained in Government Code Sections 65915-65918.
In order to be eligible for a density bonus and other incentives as provided by this Section, a proposed housing development
shall comply with the eligibility requirements specified in Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918. A density bonus and
applicable incentives or concessions shall be granted if an applicant for a housing development seeks and agrees to construct a
development that contains low-income, very low-income, moderate-income, and/or senior housing units, and it is consistent with
one of the following as the required percentages of which are outlined set forth in Government Code Section 65915(b)(1):
At least 5% of the for-sale or rental housing units are restricted to very low-income residents.
At least 10% of the for-sale or rental housing units are restricted to lower income residents.
At least 10% of the housing units in a for-sale development are restricted to moderate income residents.
At least 33% of the housing units in a proposed condominium project (from an apartment conversion) are
restricted to low or moderate income residents, or at least 15% of the housing units are restricted to lower income
residents.
100% of the housing units (other than manager's units) are restricted to very low, lower and moderate-income
residents (with a maximum of 20% moderate).
At least 10% of the housing units are for transitional foster youth, disabled veterans or homeless persons, withArcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

of 55 years and shall be provided at the same affordability level as very low income units.
At least 20% of the housing units are for low-income students in housing dedicated for full-time students at
accredited colleges. "Lower-income students" is defined in Government Code Section 65915(o)(4).
The project donates at least one acre of land to the city or county for very low-income units, and the land has the
appropriate general plan designation, zoning, permits and approvals, and access to public facilities needed for such
housing.
The project is a senior citizen housing development of at least 35 units (no affordable units required).
The project is a mobile home park age-restricted to senior citizens (no affordable units required).
 Developers obtaining a density bonus are required to replace existing units which are occupied by very
low- or lower-income households, at the time of the density bonus application. Developers are also required to replace existing
units which were occupied by very low- or lower-income households that have been demolished or vacated within a five-year
period preceding the density bonus application. The housing development must also meet the applicable affordable housing
standards, including the replacement units.
(Ord. No. 2390, § 4(Exh. B), 9-6-22; Ord. No. 2400, § 4(Exh. A), 2-20-24)9103.15.030 - Incentives and Concessions. The amount of a density bonus and the extent of other incentives allowed for a
proposed housing development shall be determined by the Council in compliance with Government Code Section
65915. If a density bonus or other incentives cannot be accommodated on a site due to strict compliance with the
provisions of this Development Code, the Council may modify or waive other development standards as necessary to
accommodate all bonus units and other incentives to which the development is entitled.
 The calculation of a density bonus in compliance with this subsection that results in
fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number, as required by State law. For the purposes of calculating
a bonus, the residential units do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or lots. A minimum density
bonus of 20% and up to 80% above the maximum density will be calculated as follows:

Council. If a development standard would physically prevent the project from being constructed at the permitted
density even with approved concessions and incentives, a developer may propose to have that standard waived or
reduced. A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards shall neither reduce nor increase the
number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled to per Section 2 above, unless the concession
is to the development standards.
 The Council shall grant the concession or incentive
requested by the applicant unless the Council makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of any of
the following:
The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in
Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5, or for rents for the targeted units to be set in compliance with
Government Code Section 65915(c); or
The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined by Government Code Section
65589.5(d)(2), upon public health and safety, or on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical
Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse
impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households; or
The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law.
 The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to
require a General Plan amendment, Zoning Map amendment, or other discretionary approval.
 Affordable housing projects benefit from parking standards that require fewer
parking spaces than typical market-rate housing projects. Upon the developer's request, the City shall not require avehicular parking ratio, inclusive of accessible and guest parking, that exceed the following ratios:Studio to one-bedroom: 1 parking space per unit.
Two to three bedrooms: 1.5 parking spaces per unit.
Four or more bedrooms: 2.5 parking spaces per unit.
If total parking calculations result in a number other than a whole number, then parking calculations shall be rounded up to
the nearest whole number. Requesting these parking standards does not count as an incentive or concession. An applicant may
request additional parking incentives beyond those included in this section. A waiver of reduction of certain development fees, or
modification of parking standards may be requested to promote the development of affordable housing. Onsite spaces may be
provided through tandem or uncovered parking, but not on-street parking.
 Lower parking ratios apply to specified projects (although the City may require
higher parking ratios if supported by a specified parking study):
Rental/for sale projects with at least 11% very low income or 20% lower income
units within ½ mile of an accessible major transit stop0.5 spaces per unit

the project, the approval of a density bonus shall require that the Planning Commission makes a recommendation to the City
Council. The City Council will make all of the following findings and will decide all Density Bonus applications.
The project will be consistent with the General Plan, except as provided by this Section with regard to maximum
density, density bonuses, and other incentives and concessions;
The approved number of dwellings can be accommodated by existing and planned infrastructure capacities;
Adequate evidence exists to indicate that the project will provide affordable housing in a manner consistent with

It has yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the prehistory or history of the city or state.
In addition to the requirements listed as 1. through 4. above in this section, an individual resource must satisfy at least
one of the following requirements:
It is listed on the National and/or California Register of Historic Places; or
It is an iconic property.
 On the recommendation of the Commission, the City Council may designate a historic district if it
meets one or more of the four criteria in Section 9103.17.060(A) and:
It possesses a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united
historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development.
A minimum of 60 percent of the buildings within the proposed historic district contribute to the district's
significance.
 Any property individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places or California
Register of Historical Resources shall be automatically considered designated historic resource by the City.
 A resource considered for listing as a local historic landmark must be
at least 45 years of age, unless it can be demonstrated that the resource has achieved exceptional importance within
the last 45 years.
 In order for a resource to be eligible for designation as a local
landmark or historic district, the resource must retain sufficient integrity. Integrity is the authenticity of a historical
resource's physical identity as evidenced by the survival of characteristics that existed during the time period within
which the resource attained significance. Only after significance has been established should the issue of integrity be
addressed. There are seven aspects of integrity, as defined by the National Register: location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and association. Since significance thresholds associated with local listing are generally less rigid
than those associated with listing at the state or national levels, a greater degree of flexibility shall be provided when
evaluating the integrity of a locally eligible historic resource, as opposed to one eligible for listing in the National or
California Registers. For this reason, it is possible that a historic resource may not retain sufficient integrity to be
eligible for listing in the National or California Registers, but may still be eligible for listing at the local level. Integrity
shall be determined with reference to the particular characteristics that support the resource's eligibility under the
appropriate criteria of significance.

(Ord. No. 2375, § 4(Exh. A), 4-6-21)9104.02.300 - Advertisement of Short Term Rentals and Home Sharing.  
Short term rentals of dwelling units and home sharing are not permitted in the city, but nonetheless, the city has
seen increased complaints related to short term rentals and home sharing due to nuisance conditions such as
noise, excessive trash, increased parking and traffic, and commercial uses of residential property. Properties
available for short term rental or home sharing are often advertised using online hosting platforms, as well as
traditional methods, and such platforms have resulted in the increase of illegal short term rentals and home
sharing in the city.
The City Council takes notice of the United States Supreme Court's opinion in the case of Central Hudson Gas &
Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission (1980) 447 U.S. 557, which held that public agencies may ban
commercial speech related to illegal activity or forms of communication that are more likely to deceive the public
than inform it.
The City has a substantial interest in banning the advertisement of uses and activities that are unlawful in the city.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank

A.Without regulating advertisements, nuisance conditions resulting from short term rentals and home sharing are
likely to persist, and visitors and guests may be deceived into believing that short term rentals are unlawful. This
chapter is no more extensive than necessary because it only regulates those persons who have an interest in the
property from placing advertisements for uses that are unlawful. The restriction on advertisements only applies to
the particular unlawful uses that are regularly advertised to members of the public, including guests and visitors to
the city, who may be unaware that the use is unlawful. This chapter does not infringe on any speech related to
lawful commercial activities.
 It shall be unlawful for an owner, tenant, property manager, agent or any other person
with possession or control of residential property to cause to be posted, published, circulated, or broadcasted any
advertisement for a short-term rental or home sharing of the residential property if short-term rental or home sharing
is not a lawful use of the residence. "Short-term rental" and "home sharing" shall have the definitions contained in
sections 9109.01.200 and 9109.01.090, respectively, of the Arcadia Development Code.
 A violation of this Subsection shall be deemed an infraction and shall also be subject to an administrative
citation pursuant to chapter 4A of the Arcadia Municipal Code. The record owner of any property that is advertised as a
short-term rental or home sharing in violation of this Subsection shall be strictly liable for the offense, regardless of
intent. Any other person who owns, rents, manages, or otherwise has possession or control residential property and
who advertises a short-term rental or home sharing in violation of Subsection 9104.02.300 shall be liable for the
offense.
(Ord. No. 2348, § 5, 8-1-17)9104.02.310 - Smoking Lounges. The Subsection establishes standards for the location, development, and operations of

applicant shall submit plans to be reviewed and approved from Planning Division and Building Division of the
Development Services Department.
 In addition to the standards for issuance of any entitlements under this Chapter 1, the ReviewAuthority may impose any conditions reasonably related to mitigate any possible adverse effect upon the public health,safety, or welfare created by the establishment and/or operation of the smoking lounge.
 In addition to the standards for issuance of any entitlements under this Chapter 1, smoking lounges
and any approval issued shall comply with applicable State codes regulating smoking on private commercial properties.9104.02.320 - Storage Containers - Temporary Portable. This Subsection provides standards for the location, development, and operations of

courts, as defined in Division 9 (Definitions), in a residential zone and where allowed in compliance with Division 2
(Zones, Allowable Uses, and Development Standards). The purpose is to ensure that such standards and regulations
reasonably restrict and minimize any detrimental effect of the location and design and use of such courts on the
occupants of adjoining properties and the neighborhood. Sports courts that do not require the installation, temporarily
or permanently, of nets, stands, seats, poles, lighting, fencing, windscreen, and any structure, and do not propose
grading to accommodate the sport court, are exempt from the provisions of this Subsection.
 No person or persons shall construct, erect, or maintain a sports court in a
residential zone without filing for and receiving approval of Site Plan and Design Review. Site Plan and Design Review
shall not be approved for a sports court in a residential zone unless its use is accessory to a primary residential use of a
residentially zoned parcel and is to be located on the same parcel as the primary residential use and conform to the
requirements of this Subsection.

 There is created a special fund to be known and designated as the Park Facilities Impact Fee Program
("Program"). The Council may establish by resolution, from time to time, a park facilities impact fee, the proceeds of
which shall be deposited in the Program.
  
The fee advances a legitimate interest of the City by enabling the City to provide park and recreation facilities and
services to new development.
The purpose is to provide a funding source for the cost to acquire and develop the land for new parks and
recreation facilities and the improvement and development of park and recreation facilities.9105.15.040 - Park Facilities Impact Fee. Council Resolution 6602, effective March 14, 2008, established a Park Facilities Impact Fee

To limit the number and extent of nonconforming uses, structures, lots, parking, signs, and characteristics of use
created by adoption of this Development Code, it is the City's intent to generally allow nonconformities to continue
until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuance.

moved, reestablished, or changed to another nonconforming use after abandonment or discontinuance or restored
after involuntary destruction, except in compliance with this Division.
The eventual intent is that nonconformities, including certain classes of nonconforming uses, nonconforming
structures of nominal value, and certain uses not meeting parking, performance, or screening standards, are to be
altered to conform.
This Division shall not apply to any use or structure established in violation of the previously adopted Zoning

the available protections provided by this Division.
The Director's determination of legal nonconformity shall be appealable in compliance with Section 9108.07

in off-street parking facilities, and solely by reason of: (1) dedication to, or customary purchase by, the City for any
public purpose; or (2) eminent domain proceedings, which result in the acquisition by the City of a portion of the
subject property, the same shall not be deemed nonconforming within the meaning of this Division.9106.01.030 - Continuation and Maintenance. Except as otherwise provided in this Division, any use, structure, or lot legally in place on the effective
date of any ordinance creating the nonconformity may continue as a legal nonconforming use, structure, or lot,

may be resumed.9106.03.020 - Nonconforming Uses Eligible for Conditional Use Permit or Other Approval. Any nonconforming use that is eligible to be considered for a Conditional
Use Permit, Minor Use Permit, or other discretionary approval under this Development Code shall be considered to be
a nonconforming use unless and until the permit or other approval is granted.
 A use lawfully existing without the approval of a Conditional Use Permit or

specified below.
The changes are, in and of themselves, in conformance with the provisions of this Development Code.
The changes are limited to minor alterations, improvements, or repairs that do not increase the degree of
nonconformity present and do not constitute or tend to produce an expansion or intensification of a
nonconforming use.
The changes are required by other laws.
The changes are determined, by the Director, to be small additions to legal-nonconforming single-family residential
properties (including multifamily dwelling units on a single-family lot) and are subject to the approval of a
Modification granted in compliance with Division 7 (Permit Processing Procedures).
The changes are incidental to the public acquisition of a portion of a site, no greater degree of nonconformity will
be created other than that caused as a result of the public acquisition, and the changed development will conform
to current regulations to the maximum extent feasible.
If the nonconforming use is discontinued, any future use of the structure(s) shall be in compliance with the provisions
of this Development Code; provided, however, that all nonconforming uses of a conforming structure shall be

reviewed, and approved or denied by the highest Review Authority designated by this Development Code for any of the
applications. For example, a project for which applications for Zoning Map Amendment and a Conditional Use Permit
are filed shall have both applications decided by the Council, instead of the Commission being the final decision making
authority for the Conditional Use Permit as otherwise required by Table 7-1 (Review Authority), above. In the example
cited, the Commission would still hear all of the applications (the Zoning Map Amendment and the Conditional Use
Permit) and forward recommendations to the Council.
  
A prospective applicant is strongly encouraged to request a pre-application conference with the Director or
designated Department Staff member before completing and filing a permit application required by this
Development Code.
The purpose of a pre-application conference is to generally:
Inform the applicant of City requirements as they apply to the proposed project;
Discuss the City's review process, possible project alternatives, or modifications; and
Identify information and materials the City will require with the application, including any necessary technical
studies and information anticipated for the environmental review of the project.
Neither the pre-application review nor the provision of information and/or pertinent policies shall be construed as
either a recommendation for approval or denial of the application or project by the City's representative.
Failure of the City's representative to identify all required studies or all applicable requirements at the time of pre-
application review shall not constitute a waiver of those studies or requirements.9107.03.030 - Eligible Applicants.An application may only be filed by the owner of the subject property or a lessee or authorized agent of the propertyowner with the written consent of the property owner.

If the structure is 50 years old or older, or the age of the structure cannot be determined, a qualified Architectural
Historian or Historian, at the expense of the property owner, shall conduct an assessment to determine if the
structure and/or site has any historical significance and is eligible for listing in the California Register of Historic
Resources. The application shall provide evidence and supporting documentation as to the historic significance or
lack of significance of the structure, including photographic evidence as to the current condition, and an evaluation
by a qualified Architectural Historian or Historian. If a survey was completed of the subject structure and the survey
is more than five years old, the survey can only be used as a guide.
The qualified Architectural Historian or Historian shall document the structure and complete a full evaluation of the
structure(s) and/or site and complete the California Department of Parks and Recreation Primary Record Form (DPR
523A), a Building, Structure, and Object (BSO) Record Form (DPR 523B); and Location Map Form (DPR 523J) and
submit the forms with the City's application for a Certificate of Demolition. Detailed instructions for preparing the
documentation forms may be found at the California Office of Historic Preservation website.
If a complete set of DPR forms was required, the evaluator shall submit the completed DPR forms to the South

Register of Historical Resources, per the definitions in Section 21084.1 of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) Statute and Section 15064.5 of the CEQA Guidelines. Under CEQA, evaluation of the potential impact to "historic
resources" is a two-step process: the first is to determine whether the property is an "historic resource" as defined in
Section 15064.5(a)(3) of CEQA; and, if it is an "historic resource," the second is to evaluate whether the action or project
proposed by the Applicant would cause a "substantial adverse change" or "materially impaired" to the historic
resource. Once this determination has been made, the type of environmental documentation needed for the proposed
project can be determined.9107.07.040 - Director's Review.Within 30 days following the receipt of an Application for a Certificate of Demolition and the evaluation of the structure
that was completed by a qualified Architectural Historian or Historian, the Director shall evaluate the request and
consider all of the following Secretary of the Interior's Standards:
The architectural, cultural, or historical significance of the structure;
The age of the structure;
The state of repair of the structure in question;
Additions, alterations, changes, modifications, and updates to the exterior architectural features of the structure
that would disqualify it from consideration for registration on the National Register of Historic Places or on the
California Register of Historic Places; and
All other factors it finds necessary and appropriate to carry out the intent of this process.
If the Director determines that the structure may be demolished or removed based on the evaluation completed by a
qualified Architectural Historian or Historian, the Building Official shall issue a Demolition Permit after a Building
Permit has been issued for a new replacement structure by Building Services.
If the Director determines that there is substantial evidence that the structure reasonably meets national, State, or
local criteria for historical significance, the Director may refer the request to the Commission.9107.07.050 - Referral to Commission. An application for a Certificate of Demolition that has been referred by the Director to the
Commission shall be accompanied by an environmental document, full evaluation of the potential historic resource,
plans, and specifications for the proposed new construction, including other necessary documents to support the
request. An application shall be filed and processed in compliance with Section 9107.03 (Application Processing
Procedures) and with the required fee in compliance with the Fee Schedule.
 The Commission shall consider the Certificate of Demolition at a public hearing. The
public hearing shall be scheduled once the Director has determined the application complete. Notice of the public
hearing shall be given and the hearing shall be conducted in compliance with to Section 9108.13 (Public Notices and
Hearings).
 Should avoidance of demolition and/or preservation not be a feasible option, the Commission may require
the qualified Architectural Historian or Historian to develop a mitigation program as part of the Initial Study that may
include, but would not be limited to, formal documentation of the structure using historical narrative and photographic
documentation, façade preservation, or placement of a plaque or historical marker.

Administration) shall apply following the decision on a Certification of Demolition application.Section 9107.09 - Conditional Use Permits and Minor Use Permits9107.09.010 - Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Section is to provide two distinct procedures for reviewing land uses that may be
appropriate in the applicable zone, but whose effects on a site and surroundings cannot be determined before being
proposed for a specific site.
 Certain types of land uses may require special conditions in a particular zone or physical
location within the City as a whole because they possess unique characteristics or present special problems that make
automatic inclusion as allowed uses either impractical or undesirable due to potential and unforeseeable impacts to
the surrounding area.
 The Conditional Use Permit and Minor Use Permit procedures are intended to provide sufficient flexibility in the
use regulations in order to further the objectives of this Development Code and to provide the City with the

A.Section 9107.17 - Reasonable Accommodation9107.17.010 - Purpose and Intent.It is the policy of the City to provide individuals with disabilities Reasonable Accommodation in rules, policies, practices,
and procedures to ensure the equal access to housing and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with
disabilities in compliance with the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the Federal Fair Housing Act, Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (referred to in this Section as the "Acts"). This Section
provides a procedure for making requests for Reasonable Accommodations in land use, zoning and building regulations,
policies, practices, and procedures of the City to comply fully with the purpose and intent of the fair housing laws and
the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA).9107.17.020 - Applicability.  
A request for Reasonable Accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative or any
entity, when the application of a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy, or practice acts as a barrier to fair
housing opportunities.
A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one
or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having this type of impairment, or anyone who has a
record of this type of impairment.
This Section is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled or handicapped under the Acts.
  
A request for Reasonable Accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards, and
practices for the siting, development, and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate
regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.
A request for Reasonable Accommodation shall comply with Subsection 9107.17.030 (Application Requirements),
below.
 Deviations from the requirements and regulations specified in this Development Code may be approved if it is
found that consistent with the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), enforcement of a
regulation results in a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or
institution, unless it is determined that imposition of the burden on that assembly, institution, or person accomplishes
furtherance of a compelling governmental interest where the burden is found to be the least restrictive means of
furthering that compelling governmental interest.
(Ord. No. 2400, § 4(Exh. A), 2-20-24)9107.17.030 - Application Requirements. An application for a Reasonable Accommodation shall be filed and processed in compliance with Section
9107.03 (Application Processing Procedures). The application shall include the information and materials specified in
the most up-to-date Department handout for Reasonable Accommodation applications. Any information identified by
an applicant as confidential shall be retained in a manner to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and shall not be
made available for public inspection. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence in support of the
findings required by Subsection 9107.17.060 (Findings and Decision), below. Initial review of the application, including

other discretionary permit.
(Ord. No. 2400, § 4(Exh. A), 2-20-24)9107.17.040 - Review Authority. A request for Reasonable Accommodation shall be reviewed, and a determination shall be made, by the
Director if no approval is sought other than the request for Reasonable Accommodation.
 A request for Reasonable Accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another
discretionary land use application shall be reviewed and determined by the authority reviewing the companion
discretionary land use application.9107.17.050 - Review Procedures. The Director shall make a written determination within 30 days following the submittal of a
complete application and either approve, approve with modifications, or deny a request for ReasonableAccommodation in compliance with Subsection 9107.17.060 (Findings and Decision), below. For requests for reasonable accommodations involving any applications for discretionary
approval, the application for reasonable accommodation shall be processed and considered separately from any
discretionary elements of the same proposal. The applications for discretionary approval shall be separately
considered and shall be subject to the procedures for consideration in compliance with the applicable review
procedure for the companion discretionary review, depending on the type of application. The appropriate ReviewAuthority shall act on all discretionary permits, but not the reasonable accommodation requests. If necessary to reach a determination on the request for Reasonable Accommodation, the Review Authority may
request additional information from the applicant consistent with fair housing laws, specifying in detail the information
that is required. In the event that a request for additional information is made, the 30-day period to issue a decision is
stayed until the applicant responds to the request.
(Ord. No. 2400, § 4(Exh. A), 2-20-24)9107.17.060 - Findings and Decision. The written decision to approve or deny a request for Reasonable Accommodation that will be consistent
with the Acts shall be based on consideration of all of the following factors:
Whether the housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an individual defined as disabled under
the Acts;
Whether the request for Reasonable Accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an
individual with a disability under the Acts;
Whether the requested Reasonable Accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on
the City, as defined in the Fair Housing Laws and interpretive case law;
Whether the requested Reasonable Accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a City
program or law, including but not limited to land use and zoning;

 While a request for Reasonable Accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations
otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect.
 The written decision of the Review Authority shall be final unless appealed.
Within 30 days of the date of the reviewing authority's written decision, an applicant may appeal an adverse
decision. Appeals from the adverse decision shall be made in writing.
If an individual needs assistance in filing an appeal on an adverse decision, the jurisdiction will provide assistance to
ensure that the appeals process is accessible.
All appeals shall contain a statement of grounds for the appeal. Any information identified by an applicant as

expiration under appropriate circumstances (e.g., the individual defined as disabled under the Acts vacates the subject
site, etc.), unless allowed to remain in compliance with Subsection B (Discontinuance), below.
  
A Reasonable Accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is deemed ceased or discontinued
for at least 180 consecutive days. For purposes of this Subsection, the terms ceased or discontinued shall be
defined as an abandonment of the rights, irrespective of the owner's or occupant's intent.
If the person(s) initially occupying a residence vacate, the Reasonable Accommodation shall remain in effect only if
the Review Authority first determines that:
The modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered
to comply with this Development Code; or
The accommodation is to be used by another qualifying individual with a disability.
The Review Authority may request the applicant or the successor(s)-in-interest to the property to provide
documentation that subsequent occupants are qualifying persons with disabilities. Failure to provide the
documentation within 10 days following the date of a request by the Review Authority shall constitute grounds for
discontinuance by the City of a previously approved Reasonable Accommodation.

trees.
 Pruning is the removal of selected branches that are dead, a hazard to public or property, or are otherwise selected
for removal while preserving the overall form of the tree. Pruning can be done as a standard maintenance of the tree canopy and
to give a tree a more balanced appearance, to reduce the weight on one side of a tree in order to prevent the tree from toppling,

Area where the main roots join the plant stem, usually at or near ground level. Also known as the root collar.
 The root flare is the area at the base of a tree where the trunk transitions from trunk and bark tissues into root
system tissues. Roots should be growing outward from the base of a tree at the same level as the surrounding soil or slightly
above it. This creates a "flare" of roots that should always be exposed and never covered with soil or other materials.
 A circular ground radius corresponding to the distance from the trunk to the edge of the tree dripline.

during the pre-construction, demolition, construction, and post-construction development phases in order to safeguard the
health and long-term welfare of protected tree(s) on a development site.
 Thinning is a selective removal of live branches to reduce the overall density of a canopy. Routine thinning does not
necessarily improve the health of a tree; in fact, removal of foliage through pruning can reduce growth and energy reserves.
 Trimming means the alteration of the outward shape of a tree without regard to which branches are to be trimmed.
Typically results in a geometric rather than natural shape.
 Undeveloped property shall mean land which is in its natural, original, or pristine state.
 Unprotected trees shall mean trees that are not subject to the regulations stated in the Chapter.

9410, pertained to similar provisions. See Code Comparative Table and Disposition List for complete derivation.9400. - Title.The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Property Maintenance and Nuisance Abatement Code and will be
referred to herein as ''this Code."
(Ord. No. 2346, § 1, 4-4-17)9401. - Purpose and Legislative Findings.The purpose of this Code is to ensure proper maintenance of property within the City of Arcadia so that the public
health, safety and welfare are not endangered by substandard properties and the blighting effect such properties have
on the entire community in consideration of the following findings:
The City Council of the City of Arcadia ("Council") has determined that the City has an extensive and widely recognized
history and reputation for well-kept properties and that the general welfare of the City is founded, in part, upon the
appearance and maintenance of properties.
The Council has determined that the keeping or maintaining of properties at variance with the level of maintenance of
surrounding properties will result in substantial diminution in the enjoyment, use, aesthetic and property values of
such surrounding properties.
The Council has determined that it is desirous to enhance and promote the maintenance of property and the
enhancement of the livability, community appearance, and the socioeconomic conditions of the community.
The Council has further determined that the uses and abuses of property as described herein reasonably relate to the
proper exercise of police power to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
The Council has determined that the provisions prescribed herein will enhance the appearance and value of such
properties rather than be a burden on the owners thereof.
The strong role of aesthetic concerns as justification for exercise of the police power has been reemphasized by the
United States Supreme Court in the case of Members of City Council v Taxpayers for Vincent, 104 S. Ct. 2118 (1984).
Unless corrective measures of the type set forth in this Chapter are undertaken to alleviate such existing conditions,
the public health, safety and general welfare, and the property values and social and economic standards of this
community will be substantially depreciated, and the abatement of the conditions will enhance the environment of the
residents of the City.
The abatement procedures set forth in this Chapter are reasonable and afford a maximum of due process and
procedural guarantees as to affected property owners.Arcadia, CA Code of Ordinances about:blank
